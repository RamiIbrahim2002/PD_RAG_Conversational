PMID: 37577642

Abstract:
Detection and characterization of abnormalities of movement are important to develop a method for detecting early signs of Parkinson's disease (PD). Most of the current research in detection of characteristic reduction of movements due to PD, known as parkinsonism, requires using a set of invasive sensors in a clinical or controlled environment. Actigraphy has been widely used in medical research as a non-invasive data acquisition method in free-living conditions for long periods of time. The proposed algorithm uses triaxial accelerometer data obtained through actigraphy to detect walking bouts at least 10 seconds long and characterize them using cadence and arm swing. Accurate detection of walking periods is the first step toward the characterization of movement based on gait abnormalities. The algorithm was based on a Walking Score (WS) derived using the value of the auto-correlation function (ACF) for the Resultant acceleration vector. The algorithm achieved a precision of 0.90, recall of 0.77, and F1 score of 0.83 compared to the expert scoring for walking bout detection. We additionally described a method to measure arm swing amplitude.
