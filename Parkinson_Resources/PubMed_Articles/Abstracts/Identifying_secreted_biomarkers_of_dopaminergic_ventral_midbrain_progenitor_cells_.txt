Title: Identifying secreted biomarkers of dopaminergic ventral midbrain progenitor cells.
PMID: 38072935

Abstract:
Ventral midbrain (VM) dopaminergic progenitor cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells have the potential to replace endogenously lost dopamine neurons and are currently in preclinical and clinical development for treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, one main challenge in the quality control of the cells is that rostral and caudal VM progenitors are extremely similar transcriptionally though only the caudal VM cells give rise to dopaminergic (DA) neurons with functionality relevant for cell replacement in PD. Therefore, it is critical to develop assays which can rapidly and reliably discriminate rostral from caudal VM cells during clinical manufacturing.
