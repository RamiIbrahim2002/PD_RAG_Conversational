Abstract:
A full rollout of COVID-19 vaccination offers the most promising prospect of bringing the pandemic to an end. This study aimed to compare the coverage, safety, and confidence of COVID-19 vaccination between patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy individuals so as to give suggestions for future immunization programs.
