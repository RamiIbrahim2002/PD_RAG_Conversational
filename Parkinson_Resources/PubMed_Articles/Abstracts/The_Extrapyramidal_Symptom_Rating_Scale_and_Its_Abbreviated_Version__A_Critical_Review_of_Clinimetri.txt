PMID: 38061344

Abstract:
The Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale - Abbreviated (ESRS-A) is an abbreviated version of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) with instructions, definitions, and a semi-structured interview that follows clinimetric concepts of measuring clinical symptoms. Similar to the ESRS, the ESRS-A was developed to assess four types of drug-induced movement disorders (DIMD): parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia (TD).
