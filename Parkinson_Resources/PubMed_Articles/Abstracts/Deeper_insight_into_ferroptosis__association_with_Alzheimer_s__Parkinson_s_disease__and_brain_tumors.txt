Abstract:
Ferroptosis is an emerging and novel type of iron-dependent programmed cell death which is mainly caused by the excessive deposition of free intracellular iron in the brain cells. This deposited free iron exerts a ferroptosis pathway, resulting in lipid peroxidation (LiPr). There are mainly three ferroptosis pathways viz. iron metabolism-mediated cysteine/glutamate, and LiPr-mediated. Iron is required by the brain as a redox metal for several physiological activities. Due to the iron homeostasis balance disruption, the brain gets adversely affected which further causes neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and brain tumors like glioblastoma (GBS), and glioma. Nanotechnology has played an important role in the prevention and treatment of these NDDs. A synergistic effect of nanomaterials and ferroptosis could prove to be an effective and efficient approach in the field of nanomedicine. In the current review, the authors have highlighted all the latest research in the field of ferroptosis, specifically emphasizing on the role of major molecular key players and various mechanisms involved in the ferroptosis pathway. Moreover, here the authors have also addressed the correlation of ferroptosis with the pathophysiology of NDDs and theragnostic effect of ferroptosis and nanomaterials for the prevention and treatment of NDDs.
