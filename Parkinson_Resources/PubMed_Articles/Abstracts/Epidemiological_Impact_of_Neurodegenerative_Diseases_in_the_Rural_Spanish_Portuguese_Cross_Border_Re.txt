PMID: 38128506

Abstract:
Epidemiological data indicate that neurodegenerative diseases show a high prevalence with a progressive increasing trend, especially in aging populations, as is the case in rural areas. The objective of this study was to assess the quantitative impact of neurodegenerative diseases in rural areas of the Spanish-Portuguese border region and to describe the epidemiological profile of the most prevalent disorders in one of the most depopulated and aged regions of Europe.
