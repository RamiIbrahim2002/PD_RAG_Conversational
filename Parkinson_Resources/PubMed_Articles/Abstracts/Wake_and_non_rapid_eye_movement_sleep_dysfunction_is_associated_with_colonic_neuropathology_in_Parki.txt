Abstract:
The body-first Parkinson's disease (PD) hypothesis suggests initial gut Lewy body pathology that propagates to the pons before reaching the substantia nigra, and subsequently progresses to the diencephalic and cortical levels. This disease course may also be the most likely in PD with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD).
