Title: Comparative efficacy and safety of adjunctive drugs to levodopa for fluctuating Parkinson's disease - network meta-analysis.
PMID: 37853009

Abstract:
It remains unclear which adjunctive drug for Parkinson's disease (PD) in combination with levodopa is more effective, tolerable, and safe. We aimed to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety among anti-PD drugs from several classes in patients with fluctuating PD who received levodopa through network meta-analysis (NMA). Twelve anti-PD drugs belonging to 4 different drug classes (dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors, catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors, and an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist) were selected. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing placebo with anti-PD drug or among anti-PD drugs in patients with PD who experienced motor fluctuations or wearing-off and received levodopa. We included 54 RCTs in the analysis. The NMA was performed under a frequentist framework using a random-effects model. The efficacy outcome was change in daily off-time, and the tolerability outcome was discontinuation due to all causes. Safety outcomes included discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) and the incidence of AEs, dyskinesia, hallucination, and orthostatic hypotension. According to the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) in the NMA, ropinirole transdermal patch (SUCRA, 0.861) ranked the highest in efficacy, followed by pramipexole (0.762), ropinirole extended release (ER) (0.750), and safinamide (0.691). In terms of tolerability, ropinirole (0.954) ranked the highest, followed by pramipexole (0.857), safinamide (0.717), and ropinirole ER (0.708). Each anti-PD drug had different SUCRA ranking profiles for the safety outcomes. These findings suggest that ropinirole, pramipexole, and safinamide are well-balanced anti-PD drugs that satisfy both efficacy and tolerability outcomes.
