Title: Transdermal Nicotine Treatment and Progression of Early Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 38320207

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies show that smokers have a lower incidence of Parkinson’s disease. Nicotine has been hypothesized to slow progression in early Parkinson’s disease. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial, we randomly assigned patients with Parkinson’s disease, diagnosed within 18 months, who were in Hoehn and Yahr disease stage less than or equal to 2 (range from 0 to 5; higher scores indicate greater impairment), who were therapy naïve (except for stable monoamine-oxidase-B inhibition), and not requiring dopaminergic therapy, to transdermal nicotine or placebo. The primary end point was change in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale parts I–III (Total UPDRS) score (range from 0 to 172; higher scores indicate greater impairment) between baseline and 60 weeks (52 weeks of trial therapy, 8 weeks of washout). The first secondary end point was change in Total UPDRS from baseline to 52 weeks. Differences between groups were estimated using the Hodges–Lehmann (HL) method and tested with the exact two-sided stratified Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Among 163 participants, 101 were assessed for the primary end point. Mean worsening of Total UPDRS was 3.5 in the placebo versus 6.0 in the nicotine group (HL-difference with 95% CI: –3 [–6 to 0], P=0.06). For the first secondary end point, analysis of 138 participants showed a mean worsening of 5.4 in the placebo versus 9.1 in the nicotine group (HL-difference with 95% CI: –4 [–7 to –1]). Dropout was mainly because of early treatment discontinuation or adverse events. Cutaneous adverse effects at the patch application site were common. In all, 34.6% of participants initiated dopaminergic therapy during participation. CONCLUSIONS: One-year transdermal nicotine treatment did not slow progression in early Parkinson’s disease. (Funded by the Michael J.
