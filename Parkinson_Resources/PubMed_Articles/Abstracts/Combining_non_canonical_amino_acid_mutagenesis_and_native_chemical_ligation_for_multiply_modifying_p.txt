Title: Combining non-canonical amino acid mutagenesis and native chemical ligation for multiply modifying proteins: A case study of α-synuclein post-translational modifications.
PMID: 37549799

Abstract:
The Parkinson's disease associated protein α-synuclein (αS) has been found to contain numerous post-translational modifications (PTMs), in both physiological and pathological states. One PTM site of particular interest is serine 87, which is subject to both O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (gS) modification and phosphorylation (pS), with αS-pS<sub>87</sub> enriched in Parkinson's disease. An often-overlooked aspect of these PTMs is their effect on the membrane-binding properties of αS, which are important to its role in regulating neurotransmitter release. Here, we show how one can study these effects by synthesizing αS constructs containing authentic PTMs and labels for single molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements. We synthesize αS-gS<sub>87</sub> and αS-pS<sub>87</sub> by combining native chemical ligation with genetic code expansion approaches. We introduce the fluorophore by a click reaction with a non-canonical amino acid. Beyond the specific problem of PTM effects on αS, our studies highlight the value of this combination of methods for multiply modifying proteins.
