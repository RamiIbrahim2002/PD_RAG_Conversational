Title: Targeted examination of amyloid beta and tau protein accumulation via positron emission tomography for the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on the A/T(N) research framework.
PMID: 38043158

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases among the older population. Its main pathological features include the abnormal deposition of extracellular amyloid-β plaques and the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of tau proteins. Its clinical presentation is complex. This review introduces the pathological processes in AD and other common neurodegenerative diseases. It then discusses the positron emission tomography (PET) probes that target amyloid-β plaques and tau proteins for diagnosing AD. According to the A/T(N) research framework, combined targeted amyloid-β and tau protein detection via PET to further improve the diagnostic accuracy of AD. In particular, the properties of the <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir and <sup>18</sup>F-MK6240 tracers-may be more beneficial in helping to differentiate AD from other common neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, the A/T(N) research framework should be used as the clinical diagnosis model of AD in the future.
