Title: The visual stimulation in disorders of consciousness.
PMID: 38104423

Abstract:
Severe brain damage usually leads to disorders of consciousness (DOC), which include coma, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and a minimally conscious state (MCS). Visual stimulation is widely used, especially in the diagnosis and treatment and treatment of DOC. Researchers have indicated that tests based on visual stimulation including visual pursuit, when used in conjunction with the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, are able to differentiate between UWS from an MCS. Recently, targeting patients' circadian rhythms has been proposed to be a possible treatment target for DOC. Indeed, light therapy has been applied in some other fields, including treating seasonal affective disorder, sleep problems, and Parkinson's disease. However, at present, although visual stimulation and light therapy are frequently used in DOC, there is still no international unified standard. Therefore, we recommend the development of an international consensus in regard to the definitions, operational criteria and assessment procedures of visual stimulation and light therapy. This review combines visual stimulation, circadian rhythm recovery, and light therapy in DOC patients and presents the mechanisms and current advances in applications related to light therapy and visual stimulation in an attempt to provide additional ideas for future research and treatment of DOC.
