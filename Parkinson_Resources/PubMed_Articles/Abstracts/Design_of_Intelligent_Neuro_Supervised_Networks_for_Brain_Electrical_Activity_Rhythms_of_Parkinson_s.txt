PMID: 37504210

Abstract:
The objective of this paper is to present a novel design of intelligent neuro-supervised networks (INSNs) in order to study the dynamics of a mathematical model for Parkinson's disease illness (PDI), governed with three differential classes to represent the rhythms of brain electrical activity measurements at different locations in the cerebral cortex. The proposed INSNs are constructed by exploiting the knacks of multilayer structure neural networks back-propagated with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Bayesian regularization (BR) optimization approaches. The reference data for the grids of input and the target samples of INSNs were formulated with a reliable numerical solver via the Adams method for sundry scenarios of PDI models by way of variation of sensor locations in order to measure the impact of the rhythms of brain electrical activity. The designed INSNs for both backpropagation procedures were implemented on created datasets segmented arbitrarily into training, testing, and validation samples by optimization of mean squared error based fitness function. Comparison of outcomes on the basis of exhaustive simulations of proposed INSNs via both LM and BR methodologies was conducted with reference solutions of PDI models by means of learning curves on MSE, adaptive control parameters of algorithms, absolute error, histogram error plots, and regression index. The outcomes endorse the efficacy of both INSNs solvers for different scenarios in PDI models, but the accuracy of the BR-based method is relatively superior, albeit at the cost of slightly more computations.
