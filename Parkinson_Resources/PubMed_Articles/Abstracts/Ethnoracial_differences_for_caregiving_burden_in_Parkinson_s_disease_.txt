Title: Ethnoracial differences for caregiving burden in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37952272

Abstract:
Caregivers play an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment, especially as the disease progresses. As the symptom profile and needs of people with PD (PwP) differ across ethnoracial groups, whether caregiving needs also differ for different ethnoracial groups should be investigated.
