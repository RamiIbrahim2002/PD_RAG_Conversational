Title: Physiological and clinical responses to cycling 7850 km over 85 days in a physically active middle-aged man with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37474301

Abstract:
This case characterizes the clinical motor, perceived fatigue, gait and balance, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and cardiopulmonary responses after cycling 7850 km over 85 days in a physically active 57-year-old male with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). The participant cycled 73/85 days (86%); averaging 107.5 ± 48.9 km/day over 255.4 ± 108.8 min. Average cycling heart rate was 117 ± 11 bpm. The Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III motor score decreased from 46 to 26 (-44%), while the mean Parkinson Fatigue Scale (PFS-16) score decreased from 3.4 to 2.3 (-32%). Peak power output on a maximal aerobic exercise test increased from 326 to 357 W (+10%), while peak isotonic power of single-leg knee extension increased from 312 to 350 W (+12%). Maximal oxygen uptake following the trip was 53.1 mL/min/kg or 151% of predicted. Resting heart rate increased from 48 to 71 bpm (+48%). The systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses to a 2-min submaximal static handgrip exercise were near absent at baseline (∆2/∆2 mm Hg) but appeared normal post-trip (∆17/∆9 mm Hg). Gait and static balance measures were unchanged. This case report demonstrates the capacity for physiological and clinical adaptations to a high-volume, high-intensity cycling regiment in a physically active middle-aged male with PD.
