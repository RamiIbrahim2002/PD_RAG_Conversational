Title: Overview on wearable sensors for the management of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37919332

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is affecting about 1.2 million patients in Europe with a prevalence that is expected to have an exponential increment, in the next decades. This epidemiological evolution will be challenged by the low number of neurologists able to deliver expert care for PD. As PD is better recognized, there is an increasing demand from patients for rigorous control of their symptoms and for therapeutic education. In addition, the highly variable nature of symtoms between patients and the fluctuations within the same patient requires innovative tools to help doctors and patients monitor the disease in their usual living environment and adapt treatment in a more relevant way. Nowadays, there are various body-worn sensors (BWS) proposed to monitor parkinsonian clinical features, such as motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, tremor, bradykinesia, freezing of gait (FoG) or gait disturbances. BWS have been used as add-on tool for patients' management or research purpose. Here, we propose a practical anthology, summarizing the characteristics of the most used BWS for PD patients in Europe, focusing on their role as tools to improve treatment management. Consideration regarding the use of technology to monitor non-motor features is also included. BWS obviously offer new opportunities for improving management strategy in PD but their precise scope of use in daily routine care should be clarified.
