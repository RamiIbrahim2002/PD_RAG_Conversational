Title: Unraveling neurotransmitter changes in de novo GBA-related and idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37558169

Abstract:
Presently, neurotransmitter deficits in GBA-related Parkinson's disease (GBA-PD) and relationships with cognitive impairment are poorly understood. A better understanding of neurotransmitter impairments in GBA-PD - particularly in the newly diagnosed drug-na√Øve phase - may support developing targeted intervention strategies. We aimed to investigate patterns of neurotransmitter deficits in GBA-PD and idiopathic PD (iPD) and cognitive performance correlations.
