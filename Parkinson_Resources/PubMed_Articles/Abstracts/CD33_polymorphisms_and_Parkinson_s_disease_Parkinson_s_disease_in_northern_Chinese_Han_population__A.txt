PMID: 37479176

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) represents the multisystem illness involving immunological and neuroinflammatory dysfunction. The present work focused on evaluating link of CD33 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with PD vulnerability of the northern Chinese Han people, considering CD33's role as a critical immunoregulatory receptor in neuroinflammatory responses.
