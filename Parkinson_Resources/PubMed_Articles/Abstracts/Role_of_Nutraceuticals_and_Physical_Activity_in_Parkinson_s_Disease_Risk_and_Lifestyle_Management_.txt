PMID: 37638586

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease is a complicated, gradually progressive neurological illness characterized by locomotor and non-motor symptomatology that impedes daily activities. Despite significant advances in symptomatic therapies with various extents of negative effects, there are currently no disease-modifying medicinal alternatives. Symptoms worsen, creating an additional strain that reduces living quality and creates the perception that prescription drugs are no longer productive.
