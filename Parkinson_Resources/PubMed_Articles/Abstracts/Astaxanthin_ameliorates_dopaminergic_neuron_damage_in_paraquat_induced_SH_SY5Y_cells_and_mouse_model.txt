PMID: 37708917

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second largest neurodegenerative disorder caused by the decreased number of dopaminergic (DAc) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). There is evidence that oxidative stress can contribute degeneration of DAc neurons in SNpc which is mainly caused by apoptotic cell death. Thus, suppressing oxidative stress and apoptosis of DAc neurons is an effective strategy to mitigate the progress of PD. Astaxanthin (AST) is a carotenoid, which mainly exists in marine organisms and is a powerful biological antioxidant. In this study, we aimed to determine the neuroprotective effect of AST on paraquat (PQ) -induced models of PD in vitro and in vivo. Here, we showed that AST significantly enhanced cell survival of SH-SY5Y cells against PQ toxicity by suppressing apoptotic cell death and oxidative stress. Moreover, we found that AST significantly ameliorated PQ-induced behavioral disorders associated with PD in C57BL/6Â J mice and the damage to DAc neurons in the SNpc of mice. Lastly, we found that the neuroprotective effects of AST were conducted through inhibiting PQ-induced activation of MAPK signaling. In conclusion, our study indicates that AST had a strong protective effect on PQ-induced oxidative stress and antagonized apoptotic cell death in SH-SY5Y cells and PQ-induced mice PD model, which might provide new insights of AST for PD treatment.
