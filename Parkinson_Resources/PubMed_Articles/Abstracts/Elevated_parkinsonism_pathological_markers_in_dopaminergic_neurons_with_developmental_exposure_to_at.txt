Title: Elevated parkinsonism pathological markers in dopaminergic neurons with developmental exposure to atrazine.
PMID: 37949145

Abstract:
Atrazine (ATZ) is one of the most used herbicides in the US and a known endocrine disruptor. ATZ is frequently detected in drinking water, especially in Midwestern regions of the United States, exceeding the EPA regulation of maximum contamination level (MCL) of 3 ppb. Epidemiology studies have suggested an association between ATZ exposure and neurodegeneration. Less, however, is known about the neurotoxic mechanism of ATZ, particularly for exposures at a developmental stage. Here, we exposed floor plate progenitors (FPPs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to low concentrations of ATZ at 0.3 and 3 ppb for two days followed by differentiation into dopaminergic (DA) neurons in ATZ-free medium. We then examined the morphology, activity, pathological protein aggregation, and transcriptomic changes of differentiated DA neurons. We observed significant decrease in the complexity of neurite network, increase of neuronal activity, and elevated tau- and α-synuclein (aSyn) pathologies after ATZ exposure. The ATZ-induced neuronal changes observed here align with pathological characteristics in Parkinson's disease (PD). Transcriptomic analysis further corroborates our findings; and collectively provides a strong evidence base that low-concentration ATZ exposure during development can elicit increased risk of neurodegeneration.
