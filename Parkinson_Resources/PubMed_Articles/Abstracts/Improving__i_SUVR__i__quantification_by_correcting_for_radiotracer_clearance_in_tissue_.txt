Title: Improving <i>SUVR</i> quantification by correcting for radiotracer clearance in tissue.
PMID: 37589538

Abstract:
Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (<i>SUVR</i>) is a widely reported semi-quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) outcome measure, partly because of its ease of measurement from short scan durations. However, in brain, <i>SUVR</i> is often a biased estimator of the gold-standard distribution volume ratio (<i>DVR</i>) due to non-equilibrium conditions, i.e., clearance of the radiotracer in relevant tissues. Factors that affect radiotracer metabolism and clearance such as medication or subject groups could lead to artificial differences in <i>SUVR</i>. This work developed a correction that reduces the bias in <i>SUVR</i> (estimated from a short 15-30 min PET imaging session) by accounting for the effects of tracer clearance observed during the late <i>SUVR</i> time window. The proposed correction takes the form of a one-step non-linear algebraic transform of <i>SUVR</i> that is a function of radiotracer dependent parameters such as clearance rates from the reference and target tissues, and population averaged reference region clearance rate (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>ref</mi></mrow></msub></math>). An important observation was the need for accurate estimation of radiotracer clearance rate in target tissue, which was addressed with a regression based model. Simulations and human data from two different radiotracers (healthy controls for [<sup>11</sup>C]LSN3172176, healthy controls and Parkinson's disease subjects for [<sup>18</sup>F]FE-PE2I) were used to validate the correction and evaluate its benefits and limitations. <i>SUVR</i> correction in human data significantly reduced mean <i>SUVR</i> bias across brain regions and subjects (from ∼25% for <i>SUVR</i> to <10% for corrected <i>SUVR</i>). This correction also significantly reduced the variability of this bias across brain regions for both tracers (approximately 50% for [<sup>11</sup>C]LSN3172176, 20% for [<sup>18</sup>F]FE-PE2I). Future work should investigate the benefits of using corrected <i>SUVR</i> in other populations and with different tracers.
