Title: The evolution of Big Data in neuroscience and neurology.
PMID: 37441339

Abstract:
Neurological diseases are on the rise worldwide, leading to increased healthcare costs and diminished quality of life in patients. In recent years, Big Data has started to transform the fields of Neuroscience and Neurology. Scientists and clinicians are collaborating in global alliances, combining diverse datasets on a massive scale, and solving complex computational problems that demand the utilization of increasingly powerful computational resources. This Big Data revolution is opening new avenues for developing innovative treatments for neurological diseases. Our paper surveys Big Data's impact on neurological patient care, as exemplified through work done in a comprehensive selection of areas, including Connectomics, Alzheimer's Disease, Stroke, Depression, Parkinson's Disease, Pain, and Addiction (e.g., Opioid Use Disorder). We present an overview of research and the methodologies utilizing Big Data in each area, as well as their current limitations and technical challenges. Despite the potential benefits, the full potential of Big Data in these fields currently remains unrealized. We close with recommendations for future research aimed at optimizing the use of Big Data in Neuroscience and Neurology for improved patient outcomes.
