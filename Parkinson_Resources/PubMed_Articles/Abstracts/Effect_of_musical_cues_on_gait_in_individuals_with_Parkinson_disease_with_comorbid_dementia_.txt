Title: Effect of musical cues on gait in individuals with Parkinson disease with comorbid dementia.
PMID: 37891141

Abstract:
Individuals with Parkinson disease and comorbid dementia (PDD) demonstrate gait impairments, but little is known about how these individuals respond to interventions for gait dysfunction. Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS), which utilizes music or other auditory cues to alter gait, has been shown to be effective for improving gait in individuals with PD without dementia, but has not been explored in individuals with PDD.
