Title: Midbrain atrophy in pathologically diagnosed Lewy body disease and clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37832378

Abstract:
Midbrain atrophy is considered specific to progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) compared with Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to determine how often midbrain atrophy is observed in pathologically diagnosed Lewy body disease (LBD) and clinically diagnosed PD and the robustness of midbrain atrophy assessed by the One-Line Method previously developed for the diagnosis of PSP.
