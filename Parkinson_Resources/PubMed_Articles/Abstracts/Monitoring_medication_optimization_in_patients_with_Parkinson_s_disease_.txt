Title: Monitoring medication optimization in patients with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38083123

Abstract:
Medication optimization is a common component of the treatment strategy in patients with Parkinson's disease. As the disease progresses, it is essential to compensate for the movement deterioration in patients. Conventionally, examining motor deterioration and prescribing medication requires the patient's onsite presence in hospitals or practices. Home-monitoring technologies can remotely deliver essential information to physicians and help them devise a treatment decision according to the patient's need. Additionally, they help to observe the patient's response to these changes. In this regard, we conducted a longitudinal study to collect gait data of patients with Parkinson's disease while they received medication changes. Using logistic regression classifier, we could detect the annotated motor deterioration during medication optimization with an accuracy of 92%. Moreover, an in-depth examination of the best features illustrated a decline in gait speed and swing phase duration in the deterioration phases due to suboptimal medication.Clinical relevance- Our proposed gait analysis method in this study provides objective, detailed, and punctual information to physicians. Revealing clinically relevant time points related to the patient's need for medical adaption alleviates therapy optimization for physicians and reduces the duration of suboptimal treatment for patients. As the home-monitoring system acts remotely, embedding it in the medical care pathways could improve patients' quality of life.
