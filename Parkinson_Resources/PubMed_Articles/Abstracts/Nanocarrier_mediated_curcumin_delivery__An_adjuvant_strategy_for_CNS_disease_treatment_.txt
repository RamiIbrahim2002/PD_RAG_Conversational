Title: Nanocarrier-mediated curcumin delivery: An adjuvant strategy for CNS disease treatment.
PMID: 38058006

Abstract:
Neurological disorders are a major global challenge, which counts for a substantial slice of disease burden around the globe. In these, the challenging landscape of central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and neuro-AIDS, demands innovative and novel therapeutic approaches. Curcumin, a versatile natural compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, shows great potential as a CNS adjuvant therapy. However, its limited bioavailability and suboptimal permeability to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) hamper the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin. This review explores how nanocarrier facilitates curcumin delivery, which has shown therapeutic efficacy for various non-CNS diseases, for example, cancers, and can also revolutionize the treatment outcomes in patients with CNS diseases. Toward this, intranasal administration of curcumin as a non-invasive CNS drug delivery route can also aid its therapeutic outcomes as an adjuvant therapy for CNS diseases. Intranasal delivery of nanocarriers with curcumin improves the bioavailability of curcumin and its BBB permeability, which is instrumental in promoting its therapeutic potential. Furthermore, curcumin's inhibitory effect on efflux transporters will help to enhance the BBB and cellular permeability of various CNS drugs. The therapeutic potential of curcumin as an adjuvant has the potential to yield synergistic effects with CNS drugs and will help to reduce CNS drug doses and improve their safety profile. Taken together, this approach holds a promise for reshaping CNS disease management by maximizing curcumin's and other drugs' therapeutic benefits.
