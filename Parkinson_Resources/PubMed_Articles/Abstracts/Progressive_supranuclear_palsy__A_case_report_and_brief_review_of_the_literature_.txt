PMID: 38028282

Abstract:
Atypical Parkinsonian syndromes are a subset of progressive neurodegenerative disorders that present with signs of Parkinson's disease. However, due to multisystem degeneration, the atypical Parkinsonian syndromes have additional symptoms that are often referred to as Parkinson-plus syndromes. The most well-studied subsets include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and Lewy body dementia. Specifically, progressive supranuclear palsy is a tauopathy neurodegenerative disorder that presents with parkinsonism symptoms along with postural instability, vertical saccade, and vertical gaze palsy. Here, we present a case of PSP and provide a brief review of the literature.
