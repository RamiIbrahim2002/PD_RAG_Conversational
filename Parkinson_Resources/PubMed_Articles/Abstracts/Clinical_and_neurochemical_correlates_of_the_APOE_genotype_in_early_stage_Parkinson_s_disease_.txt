Title: Clinical and neurochemical correlates of the APOE genotype in early-stage Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37572524

Abstract:
Emerging evidence indicates that apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype may influence Parkinson's disease (PD) course, although clinical and neurochemical correlates have not been completely established. This study aimed to determine the associations of APOE genotypes (ε4 vs. non-ε4) with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurodegeneration biomarkers and clinical parameters in early-stage PD patients. One hundred and seventy-five PD patients and 89 non-neurodegenerative controls grouped in APOE-ε4 carriers (28 PD; 12 controls) and non-APOE-ε4 carriers (147 PD; 78 controls) were enrolled. CSF levels of amyloid-β-42, amyloid-β-40, total and 181-phosphorylated tau, and clinical scores were compared among groups adjusting for main covariates. APOE genotypes prevalence was similar in PD and controls. PD APOE-ε4 carriers had lower amyloid-β-42 CSF levels than PD non-APOE-ε4 carriers and controls, independently from age. PD APOE-ε4 carriers also had higher total and "item 5" (attention and memory) non-motor symptoms scale scores than PD non-APOE-ε4 carriers, independently from confounding factors. APOE-ε4 genotype might thus account for a more vulnerable PD subtype characterized by prominent amyloidopathy and a greater burden of non-motor symptoms in the early disease stages.
