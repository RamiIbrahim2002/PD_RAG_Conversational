Title: Brain MRI Biomarkers in Isolated Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder: Where Are We? A Systematic Review.
PMID: 37891767

Abstract:
The increasing number of MRI studies focused on prodromal Parkinson's Disease (PD) demonstrates a strong interest in identifying early biomarkers capable of monitoring neurodegeneration. In this systematic review, we present the latest information regarding the most promising MRI markers of neurodegeneration in relation to the most specific prodromal symptoms of PD, namely isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). We reviewed structural, diffusion, functional, iron-sensitive, neuro-melanin-sensitive MRI, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies conducted between 2000 and 2023, which yielded a total of 77 relevant papers. Among these markers, iron and neuromelanin emerged as the most robust and promising indicators for early neurodegenerative processes in iRBD. Atrophy was observed in several regions, including the frontal and temporal cortices, limbic cortices, and basal ganglia, suggesting that neurodegenerative processes had been underway for some time. Diffusion and functional MRI produced heterogeneous yet intriguing results. Additionally, reduced glymphatic clearance function was reported. Technological advancements, such as the development of ultra-high field MRI, have enabled the exploration of minute anatomical structures and the detection of previously undetectable anomalies. The race to achieve early detection of neurodegeneration is well underway.
