Abstract:
Hypocretin/Orexin (HCRT/OX) and dopamine (DA) are both key effectors of salience processing, reward and stress-related behaviors and motivational states, yet their respective roles and interactions are poorly delineated. We inactivated HCRT-to-DA connectivity by genetic disruption of Hypocretin receptor-1 (Hcrtr1), Hypocretin receptor-2 (Hcrtr2), or both receptors (Hcrtr1&2) in DA neurons and analyzed the consequences on vigilance states, brain oscillations and cognitive performance in freely behaving mice. Unexpectedly, loss of Hcrtr2, but not Hcrtr1 or Hcrtr1&2, induced a dramatic increase in theta (7-11 Hz) electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in both wakefulness and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS). DA<sup>Hcrtr2</sup>-deficient mice spent more time in an active (or theta activity-enriched) substate of wakefulness, and exhibited prolonged REMS. Additionally, both wake and REMS displayed enhanced theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling. The baseline waking EEG of DA<sup>Hcrtr2</sup>-deficient mice exhibited diminished infra-theta, but increased theta power, two hallmarks of EEG hyperarousal, that were however uncoupled from locomotor activity. Upon exposure to novel, either rewarding or stress-inducing environments, DA<sup>Hcrtr2</sup>-deficient mice featured more pronounced waking theta and fast-gamma (52-80 Hz) EEG activity surges compared to littermate controls, further suggesting increased alertness. Cognitive performance was evaluated in an operant conditioning paradigm, which revealed that DA<sup>Hcrtr2</sup>-ablated mice manifest faster task acquisition and higher choice accuracy under increasingly demanding task contingencies. However, the mice concurrently displayed maladaptive patterns of reward-seeking, with behavioral indices of enhanced impulsivity and compulsivity. None of the EEG changes observed in DA<sup>Hcrtr2</sup>-deficient mice were seen in DA<sup>Hcrtr1</sup>-ablated mice, which tended to show opposite EEG phenotypes. Our findings establish a clear genetically-defined link between monosynaptic HCRT-to-DA neurotransmission and theta oscillations, with a differential and novel role of HCRTR2 in theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling, attentional processes, and executive functions, relevant to disorders including narcolepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's disease.
