Title: Impulse Control Disorders in Patients with Pituitary Tumors Treated with Dopamine Agonists: A Systematic Review.
PMID: 37985276

Abstract:
The increased prevalence of Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs) in dopamine agonist (DA) treated patients with Parkinson's disease is well described. Despite the frequent use of DAs in the management of pituitary tumors, the relationship between DAs and prevalence of ICDs in patients with pituitary tumours is unclear.
