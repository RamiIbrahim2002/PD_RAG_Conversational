Title: The potential of Rhein's aromatic amines for Parkinson's disease prevention and treatment: α-Synuclein aggregation inhibition and disaggregation of preformed fibers.
PMID: 38000482

Abstract:
The aggregation of α-Syn is a pivotal mechanism in Parkinson's disease (PD). Effectively maintaining α-Syn proteostasis involves both inhibiting its aggregation and promoting disaggregation. In this study, we developed a series of aromatic amide derivatives based on Rhein. Two of these compounds, 4,5-dihydroxy-N-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracene-2-carboxamide (a5) and 4,5-dihydroxy-N-(2-hydroxy-4-chlorophenyl)-9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracene-2-carboxamide (a8), exhibited good binding affinities to α-Syn residues, demonstrating promising inhibitory activity against α-Syn aggregation in vitro, with low IC<sub>50</sub> values (1.35 and 1.08 μM, respectivly). These inhibitors acted throughout the entire aggregation process by stabilizing α-Syn's conformation and preventing the formation of β-sheet aggregates. They also effectively disassembled preformed α-Syn oligomers and fibrils. Preliminary mechanistic insights indicated that they bound to the specific domain within fibrils, inducing fibril instability, collapse, and the formation of smaller aggregates and monomeric α-Syn units. This research underscores the therapeutic potential of Rhein's aromatic amides in targeting α-Syn aggregation for PD treatment and suggests broader applications in managing and preventing neurodegenerative diseases.
