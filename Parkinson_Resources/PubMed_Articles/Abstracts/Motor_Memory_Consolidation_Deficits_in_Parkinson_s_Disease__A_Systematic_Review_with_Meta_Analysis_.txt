Title: Motor Memory Consolidation Deficits in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis.
PMID: 37458048

Abstract:
The ability to encode and consolidate motor memories is essential for persons with Parkinson's disease (PD), who usually experience a progressive loss of motor function. Deficits in memory encoding, usually expressed as poorer rates of skill improvement during motor practice, have been reported in these patients. Whether motor memory consolidation (i.e., motor skill retention) is also impaired is unknown.
