Title: Nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker use and risk of Parkinson's disease: from multiple real-world evidence.
PMID: 37964359

Abstract:
People with hypertension have a higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD), epidemiological evidence suggests that multiple antihypertensives may affect the occurrence and development of PD with inconsistent results. With multisource data, we sought to determine whether specific antihypertensive classes elevated or reduced the risk for PD.
