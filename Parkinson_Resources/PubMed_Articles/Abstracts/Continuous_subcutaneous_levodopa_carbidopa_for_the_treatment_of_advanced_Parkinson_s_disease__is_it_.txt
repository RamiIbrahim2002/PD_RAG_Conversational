Title: Continuous subcutaneous levodopa-carbidopa for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease: is it an improvement on other delivery?
PMID: 37634938

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and is growing in prevalence and disability. The standard treatment for PD is oral levo-dopa (LD) with carbidopa (CD). As PD progresses, despite higher doses of LD/CD, plasma levels of LD fluctuate, and may be associated with motor fluctuations and dyskinesia.
