PMID: 38237262

Abstract:
Exercise and physical activity (PA) are increasingly recognized as important components in the management of Parkinson's disease (PD). Their promotion at diagnosis is essential for better management of symptoms and overall well-being. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are pivotal to the promotion of exercise and PA, but there is limited guidance on the content of such interventions. This study describes current practice, and explores views of HCPs around PA and exercise promotion at diagnosis for people with PD (PwP) DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using an anonymous online survey.
