Title: Laser-light Visual Cueing Shoes with Foot Pressures and Inertial Sensing for Individuals with Parkinson's Disease<sup></sup>.
PMID: 38082776

Abstract:
Gait disorder is a core problem in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), including bradykinesia, shuffling steps, festinating gait, and freeze of gait (FOG). Laser-light visual cueing has been demonstrated to be efficient in the mediation of gaits and the reduction in number of FOG episodes. However, previous approaches commonly adopted independent controls of visual cueing on left and right sides which was prone to produce two cues while individual was not in normal walking. In this study, we developed laser-light visual shoes which produced interlaced visual cues for left and right feet in a manner of one-side cueing at a time, solving the aforementioned problem. With parallel measurement of foot inertial data and foot pressures in each shoe, our results showed that the proposed visual cueing made PD individuals in the on-medication condition walk with a longer stance and swing times, that is, they walked more carefully and stable. The proposed approach can also be used to study kinematic and kinetic characteristics of gaits in the off-medication condition to clarify the mediation of visual cueing on motor control of PD individuals.Clinical Relevance- This demonstrates the effect of laser-light visual cueing on gaits in individuals with Parkinson's disease.
