Title: Multi-muscle synergies in preparation for gait initiation in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37524005

Abstract:
We investigated changes in indices of muscle synergies prior to gait initiation and the effects of gaze shift in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). A long-term objective of the study is to develop a method for quantitative assessment of gait-initiation problems in PD.
