Title: Video See-Through Pipelines for Virtual Reality Headsets and their Impact on Gait.
PMID: 38082690

Abstract:
This study investigated the impact of different video see-through pipelines in virtual reality on gait. A mobility task was conducted with healthy participants to evaluate the gait adaptions using different video see-through pipelines. The gait parameters observed for this study were stride length, maximum toe clearance and walking speed. The results showed an impact on gait where the gait parameters were reduced when participants used a high latency and restricted field of view pipeline. However, when participants used a pipeline with low latency and a field of view closer to normal vision, less impact on gait was achieved. As virtual reality poses a promising future for gait rehabilitation in patients with Parkinson's disease, this result highlights the need to carefully consider the video see-through pipeline and display characteristics when considering its use for gait rehabilitation or mobility studies in general.Clinical relevance- This study demonstrates the impact of virtual reality systems on gait using different video see- through pipelines during a mobility task. This may be useful for clinicians who use virtual reality in gait rehabilitation and aid them in choosing the most suitable virtual reality system for therapy.
