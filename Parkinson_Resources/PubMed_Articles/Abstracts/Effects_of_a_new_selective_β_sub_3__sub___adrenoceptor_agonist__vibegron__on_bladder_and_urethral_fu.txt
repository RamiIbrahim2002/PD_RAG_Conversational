Title: Effects of a new selective β<sub>3</sub> -adrenoceptor agonist, vibegron, on bladder and urethral function in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37721189

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons induces not only motor dysfunction but also lower urinary tract dysfunction. Patients with Parkinson's disease have recently been reported to experience both urge urinary incontinence (overactive bladder) and stress urinary incontinence, the latter of which occurs when the pressure of the bladder exceeds that of the urethra. Vibegron is a highly selective novel β<sub>3</sub> -adrenoceptor agonist approved for the treatment of overactive bladder. However, how β<sub>3</sub> -adrenoceptor agonists affect urethral function remains unclear. In a clinical report, the urethral function of patients with Parkinson's disease was shown to be degraded. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of vibegron on lower urinary tract activity in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.
