Title: Subjective cognitive complaints in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy.
PMID: 38156084

Abstract:
Subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) refer to self-reported cognitive decline that may or may not be reflected in objective neuropsychological evaluations. Such SCC are prevalent in neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), but the prevalence and clinical features in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) have not been investigated.
