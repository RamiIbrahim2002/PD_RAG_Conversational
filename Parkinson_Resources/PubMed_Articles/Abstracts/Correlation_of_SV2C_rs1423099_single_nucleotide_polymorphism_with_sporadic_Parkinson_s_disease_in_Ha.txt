PMID: 37544580

Abstract:
The synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2) has been implicated in synaptic function throughout the brain. Accumulating evidence investigated that SV2C contributed to dopamine release and the disrupted expression of SV2C was considered to be a unique feature of PD that may facilitate dopaminergic neuron dysfunction.
