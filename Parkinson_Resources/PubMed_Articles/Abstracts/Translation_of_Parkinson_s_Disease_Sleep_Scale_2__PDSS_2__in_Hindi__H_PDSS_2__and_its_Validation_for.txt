PMID: 37929435

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease sleep scale-2 (PDSS-2) is a reliable sleep assessment tool which has been validated in several languages. As sleep problems have a great impact on the quality of life of Parkinson's disease patients, we aimed to translate and validate PDSS-2 in Hindi for its wider use among Hindi-speaking Indian patients. Our study objective was to translate PDSS-2 in Hindi (H-PDSS-2) and to assess the psychometric properties of H-PDSS-2 questionnaire for its use in Hindi-speaking Indian PD patients. Secondly, we aimed to compare the results with those of the other language PDSS-2 validation studies.
