Title: Oxidative stress induced by sustained supraphysiological intrastriatal GDNF delivery is prevented by dose regulation.
PMID: 37766790

Abstract:
Despite its established neuroprotective effect on dopaminergic neurons and encouraging phase I results, intraputaminal GDNF administration failed to demonstrate significant clinical benefits in Parkinson's disease patients. Different human GDNF doses were delivered in the striatum of rats with a progressive 6-hydroxydopamine lesion using a sensitive doxycycline-regulated AAV vector. GDNF treatment was applied either continuously or intermittently (2 weeks on/2 weeks off) during 17 weeks. Stable reduction of motor impairments as well as increased number of dopaminergic neurons and striatal innervation were obtained with a GDNF dose equivalent to 3- and 10-fold the rat endogenous level. In contrast, a 20-fold increased GDNF level only temporarily provided motor benefits and neurons were not spared. Strikingly, oxidized DNA in the substantia nigra increased by 50% with 20-fold, but not 3-fold GDNF treatment. In addition, only low-dose GDNF allowed to preserve dopaminergic neuron cell size. Finally, aberrant dopaminergic fiber sprouting was observed with 20-fold GDNF but not at lower doses. Intermittent 20-fold GDNF treatment allowed to avoid toxicity and spare dopaminergic neurons but did not restore their cell size. Our data suggest that maintaining GDNF concentration under a threshold generating oxidative stress is a pre-requisite to obtain significant symptomatic relief and neuroprotection.
