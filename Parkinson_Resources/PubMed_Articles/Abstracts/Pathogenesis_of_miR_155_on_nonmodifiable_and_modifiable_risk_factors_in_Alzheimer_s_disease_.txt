Title: Pathogenesis of miR-155 on nonmodifiable and modifiable risk factors in Alzheimer's disease.
PMID: 37452431

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disease in the central nervous system and is the primary cause of dementia. It is clinically characterized by the memory impairment, aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, visuospatial and executive dysfunction, behavioral changes, and so on. Incidence of this disease was bound up with age, genetic factors, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular dysfunction, and other basic diseases, but the exact etiology has not been clarified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous non-coding RNAs that were involved in the regulation of post-transcriptional gene expression. miRNAs have been extensively studied as noninvasive potential biomarkers for disease due to their relative stability in bodily fluids. In addition, they play a significant role in the physiological and pathological processes of various neurological disorders, including stroke, AD, and Parkinson's disease. MiR-155, as an important pro-inflammatory mediator of neuroinflammation, was reported to participate in the progression of Î²-amyloid peptide and tau via regulating immunity and inflammation. In this review, we put emphasis on the effects of miR-155 on AD and explore the underlying biological mechanisms which could provide a novel approach for diagnosis and treatment of AD.
