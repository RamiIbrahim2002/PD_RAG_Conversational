Abstract:
The tobacco cembranoid known as (1S,2E,4R,6R,7E,11E)-2,7,11-cembratriene-4,6-diol (4R) has been shown to offer neuroprotection against conditions such as brain ischemia, systemic inflammation, Parkinson's disease, and organophosphate toxicity in rodents. Previous safety studies conducted on male and female Sprague Dawley rats revealed no significant side effects following a single injection of 4R at varying concentrations (6, 24, or 98 mg/kg of body weight). This study aimed to assess the potential of 4R for clinical trials in neurotherapy in male nonhuman primates. Ten macaques (Macacca mulatta) were randomly separated into two groups of 5 and then intravenously injected with 4R or vehicle for 11 consecutive days at a dose of 1.4 mg/kg. Throughout the study, we monitored brain activity by electroencephalogram, somatosensory evoked potentials, and transcranial motor evoked potentials on days 0, 4, 8, and 12 and found no significant changes. The spontaneous behavior of the primates remained unaffected by the treatment. Minor hematological and blood composition variations were also detected in the experimental animals but lacked clinical significance. In conclusion, our results reinforce the notion that 4R is non-toxic in nonhuman primates under the conditions of this study.
