Title: The Administration of Levodopa in a Patient With Parkinson's Disease Using a Novel Maxillofacial Route: A First-in-Human Report.
PMID: 38034171

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Dopamine cannot be administered systemically because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Oral levodopa remains the gold standard to date. Currently, for patients who show a poor response to oral levodopa and for those who cannot take it orally, the alternate routes available are inhalation and continuous administration via intestinal and subcutaneous routes. In this report, a novel maxillofacial route was used for the first time in the world to administer levodopa to a Parkinson's patient. Furthermore, the efficacy of maxillofacial administration was compared with the oral route of administration.
