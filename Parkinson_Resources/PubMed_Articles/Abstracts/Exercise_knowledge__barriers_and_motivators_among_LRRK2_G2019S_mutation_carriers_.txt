Title: Exercise knowledge, barriers and motivators among LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers.
PMID: 37441884

Abstract:
People with a Gly2019Ser mutation in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2 G2019S) are at increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent evidence suggests that exercise may delay or prevent the development of clinically overt symptoms of PD in people at risk of PD. We determined whether LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers with and without manifest PD are aware of the relationship between exercise and PD and how they differ in awareness, barriers and motivators to exercise.
