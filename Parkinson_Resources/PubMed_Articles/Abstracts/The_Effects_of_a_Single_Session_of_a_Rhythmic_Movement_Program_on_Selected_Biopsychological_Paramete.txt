Title: The Effects of a Single Session of a Rhythmic Movement Program on Selected Biopsychological Parameters in PD Patients: A Methodological Approach.
PMID: 37629698

Abstract:
The aim of the present study is to examine the acute effects of a specially designed musicokinetic (MSK) program for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) on (a) anxiety levels, (b) select kinematic and kinetic parameters, and (c) frontal cortex hemodynamic responses, during gait initiation and steady-state walking. <i>Methods</i>: This is a blind cross-over randomized control trial (RCT) in which 13 volunteers with PD will attend a 45 min MSK program under the following conditions: (a) a synchronous learning format and (b) an asynchronous remote video-based format. Changes in gait biomechanics and frontal cortex hemodynamic responses will be examined using a 10-camera 3D motion analysis (Vicon T-series, Oxford, UK), and a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (f-NIRS-Portalite, Artinis NL) system, respectively, while anxiety levels will be evaluated using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. <i>Expected results</i>: Guided by the rules of music, where periodicity is distinct, our specially designed MSK program may eventually be beneficial in improving motor difficulties and, hence, reducing anxiety. The combined implementation of f-NIRS in parallel with 3D gait analysis has yet to be evaluated in Parkinsonian patients following a MSK intervention. It is expected that the aforementioned intervention, through better rhythmicity, may improve the automatization of motor control, gait kinematics, and kinetics-supported by decreased frontal cortex hemodynamic activity-which may be linked to reduced anxiety levels.
