Title: Age-related macular degeneration and neurodegenerative disorders: Shared pathways in complex interactions.
PMID: 38000700

Abstract:
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the elderly, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease are debilitating conditions that affect millions worldwide. Despite the different clinical manifestations of these diseases, growing evidence suggests that they share common pathways in their pathogenesis including inflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired autophagy. In this review, we explore the complex interactions between AMD and neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on their shared mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. We also discuss the current opportunities and challenges for developing effective treatments that can target these pathways to prevent or slow down disease progression in AMD. Some of the promising strategies that we explore include modulating the immune response, reducing oxidative stress, enhancing autophagy and lysosomal function, and targeting specific protein aggregates or pathways. Ultimately, a better understanding of the shared pathways between AMD and neurodegenerative disorders may pave the way for novel and more efficacious treatments.
