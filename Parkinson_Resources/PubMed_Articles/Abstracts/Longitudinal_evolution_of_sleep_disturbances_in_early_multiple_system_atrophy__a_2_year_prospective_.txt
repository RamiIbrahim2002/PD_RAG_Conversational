Title: Longitudinal evolution of sleep disturbances in early multiple system atrophy: a 2-year prospective cohort study.
PMID: 37993943

Abstract:
The progression of sleep disturbances remains unclear in patients with early multiple system atrophy (MSA). We aimed to explore the frequency, severity, and coexistence of 2-year longitudinal changes of sleep disturbances including REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and Parkinson's disease-related sleep problems (PD-SP) in early MSA.
