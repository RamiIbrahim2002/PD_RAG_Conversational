Abstract:
LY-404,039 is an orthosteric agonist of metabotropic glutamate 2 and 3 receptors (mGluR<sub>2/3</sub>) that may harbour additional agonist effect at dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors. LY-404,039 and its pro-drug, LY-2140023, have previously entered clinical trials as treatment options for schizophrenia. They could therefore be repurposed, if proven efficacious, for other conditions, notably Parkinson's disease (PD). We have previously shown that the mGluR<sub>2/3</sub> orthosteric agonist LY-354,740 alleviated L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia and psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset. Unlike LY-404,039, LY-354,740 does not stimulate dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors, suggesting that LY-404,039 may elicit broader therapeutic effects in PD. Here, we sought to investigate the effect of this possible additional dopamine D<sub>2</sub>-agonist action of LY-404,039 by assessing its efficacy on dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonism in the MPTP-lesioned marmoset. We first determined the pharmacokinetic profile of LY-404,039 in the marmoset, in order to select doses resulting in plasma concentrations known to be well tolerated in the clinic. Marmosets were then injected L-DOPA with either vehicle or LY-404,039 (0.1, 0.3, 1 and 10 mg/kg). The addition of LY-404,039 10 mg/kg to L-DOPA resulted in a significant reduction of global dyskinesia (by 55%, P < 0.01) and PLBs (by 50%, P < 0.05), as well as reduction of global parkinsonism (by 47%, P < 0.05). Our results provide additional support of the efficacy of mGluR<sub>2/3</sub> orthosteric stimulation at alleviating dyskinesia, PLBs and parkinsonism. Because LY-404,039 has already been tested in clinical trials, it could be repurposed for indications related to PD.
