Title: Interactive effect of orthostatic hypotension on gray matter atrophy associated with hyposmia and RBD in de novo Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37626243

Abstract:
Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a potential modifiable risk factor for cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Although other risk factors for dementia, hyposmia and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), are closely associated with autonomic dysfunction in PD, little is known about how these risk factors influence cognitive function and cerebral pathology.
