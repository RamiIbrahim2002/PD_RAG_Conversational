Title: CCL5 promotes LFA-1 expression in Th17 cells and induces LCK and ZAP70 activation in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38020765

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD), which is associated to autoimmune disorders, is characterized by the pathological deposition of alpha-synuclein (Î±-Syn) and loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Th17 cells are thought to be responsible for the direct loss of DA neurons. C-C chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) specifically induces Th17 cell infiltration into the SN. However, the specific effect of CCL5 on Th17 cells in PD and the relationship between CCL5 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) expression in Th17 cells are unknown.
