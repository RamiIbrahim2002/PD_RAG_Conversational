PMID: 37939511

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder. Falls are common in patients with PD and can lead to disability, bedridden status, and death. The mechanisms of falls induced by symptoms of PD have not been fully clarified. We investigated the association between falls and nonmotor symptoms in PD patients.
