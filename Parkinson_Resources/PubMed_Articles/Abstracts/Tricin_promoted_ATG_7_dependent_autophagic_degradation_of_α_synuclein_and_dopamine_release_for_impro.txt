Title: Tricin promoted ATG-7 dependent autophagic degradation of α-synuclein and dopamine release for improving cognitive and motor deficits in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37586619

Abstract:
Tricin, a natural nontoxic flavonoid distributed in grasses and euphorbia plants, has been reported to scavenge free radicals, possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. However, its autophagic effect on Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been elucidated. By adopting cellular and C. elegans models of PD, the autophagic effect of tricin was identified based on the level of autophagy markers (LC3-II and p62). Besides, the pharmacological effects on neurotransmitters (dopamine), inflammatory cytokines (IFN γ, TNFα, MCP-1, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-17A), histology (hematoxylin & eosin and Nissl staining) and behavioural pathology (open-field test, hindlimb clasping, Y-maze, Morris water-maze and nest building test) were also confirmed in the A53T-α-synuclein transgenic PD mouse model. Further experiments demonstrated that tricin induced autophagic flux and lowered the level of α-synuclein through AMPK-p70s6K- and ATG7-dependent mechanism. Compared to the existing clinical PD drugs, tricin mitigated pathogenesis and symptoms of PD with no observable side effects. In summary, tricin is proposed as a potential adjuvant remedy or nutraceutical for the prevention and treatment of PD.
