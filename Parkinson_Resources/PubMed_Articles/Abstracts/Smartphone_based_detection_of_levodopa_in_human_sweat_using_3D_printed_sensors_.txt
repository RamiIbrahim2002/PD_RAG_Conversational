Title: Smartphone-based detection of levodopa in human sweat using 3D printed sensors.
PMID: 37423672

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the leading neurological disorders negatively impacting health on a global scale. Patients diagnosed with PD require frequent monitoring, prescribed medications, and therapy for extended periods as symptom severity worsens. The primary pharmaceutical treatment for PD patients is levodopa (L-Dopa) which reduces many symptoms experienced by PD patients (e.g., tremors, cognitive ability, motor dysfunction, etc.) through the regulation of dopamine levels in the body. Herein, the first detection of L-Dopa in human sweat using a low-cost 3D printed sensor with a simple and rapid fabrication protocol combined with a portable potentiostat wirelessly connected to a smartphone via Bluetooth is reported. By combining saponification and electrochemical activation into a single protocol, the optimized 3D printed carbon electrodes were able to simultaneously detect uric acid and L-Dopa throughout their biologically relevant ranges. The optimized sensors provided a sensitivity of 83 ± 3 nA/μM from 24 μM to 300 nM L-Dopa. Common physiological interferents found in sweat (e.g., ascorbic acid, glucose, caffeine) showed no influence on the response for L-Dopa. Lastly, a percent recovery of L-Dopa in human sweat using a smartphone-assisted handheld potentiostat resulted in the recovery of 100 ± 8%, confirming the ability of this sensor to accurately detect L-Dopa in sweat.
