PMID: 38001883

Abstract:
<b>Background:</b> Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1-2% of the population over the age of 60 and the majority of PD cases are sporadic, without any family history of the disease. Neuroinflammation driven by microglia has been shown to promote the progression of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuron loss through the release of neurotoxic factors. Interestingly, the risk of developing PD is significantly higher in distinct occupations, such as farming and agriculture, and is linked to the use of pesticides and herbicides. <b>Methods:</b> The neurotoxic features of 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4D) at concentrations of 10 ÂµM and 1 mM were analyzed in two distinct E14 midbrain neuron culture systems and in primary microglia. <b>Results:</b> The application of 1 mM 2,4D resulted in mDA neuron loss in neuron-enriched cultures. Notably, 2,4D-induced neurotoxicity significantly increased in the presence of microglia in neuron-glia cultures, suggesting that microglia-mediated neurotoxicity could be one mechanism for progressive neuron loss in this in vitro setup. However, 2,4D alone was unable to trigger microglia reactivity. <b>Conclusions:</b> Taken together, we demonstrate that 2,4D is neurotoxic for mDA neurons and that the presence of glia cells enhances 2,4D-induced neuron death. These data support the role of 2,4D as a risk factor for the development and progression of PD and further suggest the involvement of microglia during 2,4D-induced mDA neuron loss.
