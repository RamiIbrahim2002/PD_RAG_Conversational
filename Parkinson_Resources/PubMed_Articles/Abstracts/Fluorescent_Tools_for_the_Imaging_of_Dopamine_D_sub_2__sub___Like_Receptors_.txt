Title: Fluorescent Tools for the Imaging of Dopamine D<sub>2</sub> -Like Receptors.
PMID: 37942961

Abstract:
The family of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> -like receptors represents an interesting target for a variety of neurological diseases, e.â€‰g. Parkinson's disease (PD), addiction, or schizophrenia. In this study we describe the synthesis of a new set of fluorescent ligands as tools for visualization of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> -like receptors. Pharmacological characterization in radioligand binding studies identified UR-MN212 (20) as a high-affinity ligand for D<sub>2</sub> -like receptors (pK<sub>i</sub> (D<sub>2long</sub> R)=8.24, pK<sub>i</sub> (D<sub>3</sub> R)=8.58, pK<sub>i</sub> (D<sub>4</sub> R)=7.78) with decent selectivity towards D<sub>1</sub> -like receptors. Compound 20 is a neutral antagonist in a G<sub>o1</sub> activation assay at the D<sub>2long</sub> R, D<sub>3</sub> R, and D<sub>4</sub> R, which is an important feature for studies using whole cells. The neutral antagonist 20, equipped with a 5-TAMRA dye, displayed rapid association to the D<sub>2long</sub> R in binding studies using confocal microscopy demonstrating its suitability for fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, in molecular brightness studies, the ligand's binding affinity could be determined in a single-digit nanomolar range that was in good agreement with radioligand binding data. Therefore, the fluorescent compound can be used for quantitative characterization of native D<sub>2</sub> -like receptors in a broad variety of experimental setups.
