Title: Neurophysiology of Brain Networks Underlies Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease: A Basis for Diagnosis and Management.
PMID: 37510138

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the leading neurodegenerative disorders. It is considered a movement disorder, although it is accepted that many nonmotor symptoms accompany the classic motor symptoms. PD exhibits heterogeneous and overlaying clinical symptoms, and the overlap of motor and nonmotor symptoms complicates the clinical diagnosis and management. Loss of modulation secondary to the absence of dopamine due to degeneration of the substantia nigra compacta produces changes in firing rates and patterns, oscillatory activity, and higher interneuronal synchronization in the basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex and nigrovagal network involvement in motor and nonmotor symptoms. These neurophysiological changes can be monitored by electrophysiological assessment. The purpose of this review was to summarize the results of neurophysiological changes, especially in the network oscillation in the beta-band level associated with parkinsonism, and to discuss the use of these methods to optimize the diagnosis and management of PD.
