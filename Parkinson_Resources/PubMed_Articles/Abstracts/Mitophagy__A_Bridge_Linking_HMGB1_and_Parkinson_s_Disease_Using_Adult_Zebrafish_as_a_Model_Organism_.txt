Title: Mitophagy: A Bridge Linking HMGB1 and Parkinson's Disease Using Adult Zebrafish as a Model Organism.
PMID: 37509008

Abstract:
High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) has been implicated as a key player in two critical factors of Parkinson's disease (PD): mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. However, the specific role of HMGB1 in PD remains elusive. We investigated the effect of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) administration on mitochondrial dysfunction and HMGB1-associated inflammatory genes as well as locomotor activity in zebrafish, aiming to elucidate the role of HMGB1 in PD. Adult zebrafish received MPTP injections, and locomotor activity was measured at 24- and 48-h post-administration. Gene expression levels related to mitophagy (fis1, pink1, and park2) and HMGB1-mediated inflammation (hmgb1, tlr4, and nfkb) were quantified through RT-qPCR analysis. Following MPTP injection, the significant increase in transcript levels of fis1, pink1, and park2 indicated notable changes in PINK1/Parkin mitophagy, while the upregulation of hmgb1, tlr4, and nfkb genes pointed to the activation of the HMGB1/TLR4/NFÎºB inflammatory pathway. Furthermore, MPTP-injected zebrafish exhibited decreased locomotor activity, evident through reduced distance travelled, mean speed, and increased freezing durations. HMGB1 plays a major role in cellular processes as it is involved in both the mitophagy process and functions as a pro-inflammatory protein. MPTP administration in adult zebrafish activated mitophagy and inflammatory signaling, highlighting the significant role of HMGB1 as a mediator in both processes and further emphasizing its significant contribution to PD pathogenesis.
