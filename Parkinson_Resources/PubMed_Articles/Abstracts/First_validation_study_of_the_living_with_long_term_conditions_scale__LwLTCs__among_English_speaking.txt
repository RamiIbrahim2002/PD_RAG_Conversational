PMID: 37430315

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, affecting 10Â million people worldwide. Health and social care professionals need to have personalised tools to evaluate the process of living with Parkinson's disease and consequently, plan individualised and targeted interventions. Recently, the English version of the Living with Long term conditions (LwLTCs) scale has been developed filling an important gap related to person-centred tools to evaluate the process of living with long term conditions among English-speaking population. However, no validation studies for testing its psychometric properties have been conducted.
