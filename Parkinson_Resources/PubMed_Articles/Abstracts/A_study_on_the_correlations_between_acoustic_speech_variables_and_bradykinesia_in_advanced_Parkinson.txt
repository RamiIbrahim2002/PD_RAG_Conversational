Title: A study on the correlations between acoustic speech variables and bradykinesia in advanced Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37533469

Abstract:
Very few studies have assessed the presence of a possible correlation between speech variables and limb bradykinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to find correlations between different speech variables and upper extremity bradykinesia under different medication conditions in advanced PD patients.
