Title: The Role of Muscle Strength in the Sit-to-Stand Task in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37908843

Abstract:
Rising from a chair or the sit-to-stand (STS) task is frequently impaired in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). These patients commonly attribute such difficulties to weakness in the lower extremities. However, the role of muscle strength in the STS transfer task has not been fully elucidated.
