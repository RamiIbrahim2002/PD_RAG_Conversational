Title: Validation of Lead-DBS β-Oscillation Localization with Directional Electrodes.
PMID: 37627782

Abstract:
In deep brain stimulation (DBS) studies in patients with Parkinson's disease, the Lead-DBS toolbox allows the reconstruction of the location of β-oscillations in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) using Vercise Cartesia directional electrodes (Boston Scientific). The objective was to compare these probabilistic locations with those of intraoperative monopolar β-oscillations computed from local field potentials (0.5-3 kHz) recorded by using shielded single wires and an extracranial shielded reference electrode. For each electrode contact, power spectral densities of the β-band (13-31 Hz) were compared with those of all eight electrode contacts on the directional electrodes. The DBS Intrinsic Template AtLas (DISTAL), electrophysiological, and DBS target atlases of the Lead-DBS toolbox were applied to the reconstructed electrodes from preoperative MRI and postoperative CT. Thirty-six electrodes (20 patients: 7 females, 13 males; both STN electrodes for 16 of 20 patients; one single STN electrode for 4 of 20 patients) were analyzed. Stimulation sites both dorsal and/or lateral to the sensorimotor STN were the most efficient. In 33 out of 36 electrodes, at least one contact was measured with stronger β-oscillations, including 23 electrodes running through or touching the ventral subpart of the β-oscillations' probabilistic volume, while 10 did not touch it but were adjacent to this volume; in 3 out of 36 electrodes, no contact was found with β-oscillations and all 3 were distant from this volume. Monopolar local field potentials confirmed the ventral subpart of the probabilistic β-oscillations.
