Title: Health care experiences of people with Parkinson's disease in Australia.
PMID: 37438688

Abstract:
Little is known about the health care experiences of people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) living in Australia. Exploring health care experiences can provide insight into service gaps which can then help direct quality improvement, such as improving communication between patients and health professionals.
