Title: Dynamic Activity Model of Movement Disorders: The Fundamental Role of the Hyperdirect Pathway.
PMID: 37986211

Abstract:
Schematic illustration of cortically induced dynamic activity changes of the output nuclei of the basal ganglia (the internal segment of the globus pallidus, GPi and the substantia nigra pars reticulata, SNr) in the healthy and diseased states. The height of the dam along the time course controls the expression of voluntary movements. Its alterations could cause a variety of movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and hyperkinetic disorders. Â© 2023 The Authors.
