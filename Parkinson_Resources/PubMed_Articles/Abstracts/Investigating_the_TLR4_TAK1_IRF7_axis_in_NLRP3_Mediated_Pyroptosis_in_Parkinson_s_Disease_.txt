Title: Investigating the TLR4/TAK1/IRF7 axis in NLRP3-Mediated Pyroptosis in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37930487

Abstract:
In the realm of Parkinson's disease (PD) research, NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis has recently garnered significant attention as a potential novel form of dopaminergic neuronal death. Our previous research revealed the activation of innate immune-related genes, such as the TLR4 signaling pathway and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), although the specific mechanism remains unclear. Our current study shed light on whether the TLR4 signaling pathway and IRF7 can affect the pyroptosis of dopaminergic nerve cells and thus participate in the pathogenesis of PD. The PD model was constructed by MPP<sup>+</sup> treatment of PC12 cells or stereotactic injection of the striatum of SD rats, and the expression of genes were detected by RT-qPCR and Western Blotting. Lentivirus, siRNA and (5Z)-7-Oxozeaenol were used to validate the regulation of this pathway on pyroptosis. The expression of TLR4, TAK1, IRF7 and pyroptosis molecular markers was upregulated after MPP<sup>+</sup> treatment. IRF7 could affect dopaminergic neural cells pyroptosis by targeted regulation of NLRP3. Furthermore, inhibition of the TLR4/TAK1 signaling pathway led to a decrease in the expression of both IRF7 and NLRP3, while overexpression of IRF7 reversed the reduction in pyroptosis and increase in TH expression. TLR4/TAK1/IRF7 axis can promote PD by influencing pyroptosis through NLRP3.
