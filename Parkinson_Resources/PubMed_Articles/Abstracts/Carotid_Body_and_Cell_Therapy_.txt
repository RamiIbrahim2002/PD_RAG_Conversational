Title: Carotid Body and Cell Therapy.
PMID: 37946082

Abstract:
During the past decade, the carotid body (CB) has been considered an innovative therapeutic target for the treatment of certain cardiorespiratory and metabolic diseases most of which are sympathetically mediated. It has recently been revealed that CB stem cells provide new target sites for the development of promising cell-based therapies. Specifically, generation of CB progenitors in vitro which can differentiate into functionally active glomus cells may be a useful procedure to produce the cell mass required for replacement cell therapy. Due to their dopaminergic nature, adult glomus cells can be used for an intrastriatal grafting in neurodegenerative brain disorders including Parkinson's disease. The beneficial effect of throphic factors such as glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor synergistically released by the transplanted cells then enables the transplant to survive. Likewise, intracerebral administration of CB cell aggregates or dispersed cells has been tested for the treatment of an experimental model of stroke. The systematic clinical applicability of CB autotransplants following glomectomy in humans is under investigation. In such autotransplantation studies, cell aggregates from unilaterally resected CB might be used as autografts. In addition, stem cells could offer an opportunity for tissue expansion and might settle the issue of small number of glomus cells available for transplantation.
