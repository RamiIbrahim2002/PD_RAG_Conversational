Title: Average annual cost of Parkinson's disease in a Brazilian multiethnic population.
PMID: 37931350

Abstract:
With the current demographic transition, it is estimated that by 2050 Brazil will have a population of 90 million people aged 60 years or more, and in parallel Parkinson's disease (PD) will bring a considerable economic burden to our society. Brazil is considered multiracial due to its colonization, generating important social and regional inequalities. Knowing the costs of the PD may aid to improve local public policies. However, in Brazil, no estimates of these values have been made so far.
