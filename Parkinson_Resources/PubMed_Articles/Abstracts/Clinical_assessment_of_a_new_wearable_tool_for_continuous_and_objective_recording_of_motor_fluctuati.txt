Title: Clinical assessment of a new wearable tool for continuous and objective recording of motor fluctuations and ON/OFF states in patients with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37796842

Abstract:
Clinical rating scales typically includes subjective evaluations, and their time-limited duration may fail to capture daily fluctuations in motor symptoms resulting from Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, a new tool (i.e. the PD-Watch) has been proposed for the objective and continuous assessment of PD motor manifestations based on evaluating frequency data from a wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer and identifying specific movement patterns typically associated with disorders. This reduces the probability of confusing physiological or pathological movements occurring at the same frequency. In this work, we present a new method for assessing motor fluctuations through a wrist-worn accelerometer. We also explore the agreement between the continuous data generated by the proposed method and data reported in the patient diaries. In this study, twelve PD patients were recruited with an overall recording duration of 528 hours. Results of this preliminary study show that the proposed tool has suitable and adequate performances for analysing the motor signs of PD patients, and the estimated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the tool are 85%, 94%, and 91%, respectively.
