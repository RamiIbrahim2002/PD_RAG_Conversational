Title: A new genetic variant, presenting as young onset rapidly progressive dementia and parkinsonism.
PMID: 37726184

Abstract:
There are various neurodegenerative or hereditary causes of Parkinsonism. Therefore, clinicians should consider an increasing range of differential diagnoses when facing a patient with Parkinsonism, especially when associated with additional clinical features. Young-onset Parkinsonism, especially when accompanied by features uncommon in idiopathic Parkinson's disease raises the possibility of genetic etiology. Herein, we present a case of a 40-year-old man with genetic Parkinson's disease, presenting with rapidly progressive dementia. This round will describe our approach to this clinical presentation and the unveiling of a rare genetic condition.
