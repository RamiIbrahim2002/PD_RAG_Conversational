Title: The Beneficial Role of Photobiomodulation in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
PMID: 37509468

Abstract:
Photobiomodulation (PBM), also known as Low-level Laser Therapy (LLLT), involves the use of light from a laser or light-emitting diode (LED) in the treatment of various disorders and it has recently gained increasing interest. Progressive neuronal loss with attendant consequences such as cognitive and/or motor decline characterize neurodegenerative diseases. The available therapeutic drugs have only been able to provide symptomatic relief and may also present with some side effects, thus precluding their use in treatment. Recently, there has been an exponential increase in interest and attention in the use of PBM as a therapy in various neurodegenerative diseases in animal studies. Because of the financial and social burden of neurodegenerative diseases on the sufferers and the need for the discovery of potential therapeutic inventions in their management, it is pertinent to examine the beneficial effects of PBM and the various cellular mechanisms by which it modulates neural activity. Here, we highlight the various ways by which PBM may possess beneficial effects on neural activity and has been reported in various neurodegenerative conditions (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, TBI, stroke) with the hope that it may serve as an alternative therapy in the management of neurodegenerative diseases because of the biological side effects associated with drugs currently used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
