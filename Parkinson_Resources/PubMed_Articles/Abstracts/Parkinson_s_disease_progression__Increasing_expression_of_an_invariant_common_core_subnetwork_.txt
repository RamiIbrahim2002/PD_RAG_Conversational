Title: Parkinson's disease progression: Increasing expression of an invariant common core subnetwork.
PMID: 37660556

Abstract:
Notable success has been achieved in the study of neurodegenerative conditions using reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE) in positron emission tomography (PET) data despite their widely differing approach. In a recent study of SICE applied to metabolic scans from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, we showed that by using PCA to prespecify disease-related partition layers, we were able to optimize maps of functional metabolic connectivity within the relevant networks. Here, we show the potential of SICE, enhanced by disease-specific subnetwork partitions, to identify key regional hubs and their connections, and track their associations in PD patients with increasing disease duration. This approach enabled the identification of a core zone that included elements of the striatum, pons, cerebellar vermis, and parietal cortex and provided a deeper understanding of progressive changes in their connectivity. This subnetwork constituted a robust invariant disease feature that was unrelated to phenotype. Mean expression levels for this subnetwork increased steadily in a group of 70 PD patients spanning a range of symptom durations between 1 and 21 years. The findings were confirmed in a validation sample of 69 patients with up to 32 years of symptoms. The common core elements represent possible targets for disease modification, while their connections to external regions may be better suited for symptomatic treatment.
