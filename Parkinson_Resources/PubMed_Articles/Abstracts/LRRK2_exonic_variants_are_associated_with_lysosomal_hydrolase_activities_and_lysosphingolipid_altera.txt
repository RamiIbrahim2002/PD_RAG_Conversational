PMID: 37473971

Abstract:
Last data demonstrated that exonic variants of LRRK2 (p.G2019S, p.M1646T) may affect the catalytic activity of lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) probably through the phosphorylation of Rab10 protein. We aimed to evaluate an association of LRRK2 exonic variants previously associated with alteration of phosphorylation levels for Rab10<sup>Thr73</sup> with PD risk in Russian population and analyze an impact of p.G2019S mutation and selected LRRK2 variants on lysosomal hydrolase activities. LRRK2 variants were determined by full sequencing of LRRK2 in 508 PD patients and 470 controls from Russian population. Activity of lysosomal enzymes (glucocerebrosidase (GCase), alpha-galactosidase A (GLA), acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) and concentrations of their corresponded substrates (hexosylsphingosine (HexSph), globotriaosylsphingosine (LysoGb3), lysosphingomyelin (LysoSM), respectively) were estimated in 211 PD patients and 179 controls by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) in dry blood spots. p.M1646T and p.N2081D were associated with PD (OR = 2.33, CI 95%: 1.1215 to 4.8253, p = 0.023; OR = 1.89, 95%CI: 1.0727 to 3.3313, p = 0.028, respectively) in Russian population. An increased LysoGb3 concentration was found in p.G2019S and p.N2081D LRRK2 carriers among PD patients compared to both PD patients and controls (p.G2019S: p = 0.00086, p = 0.0004, respectively; p.N2081D: p = 0.012, p = 0.0076, respectively). A decreased ASMase activity in p.G2019S LRRK2 carriers among PD patients (p = 0.014) was demonstrated as well. Our study supported possible involvement of LRRK2 dysfunction in an alteration of sphingolipid metabolism in PD.
