Prohibitin-2 (PHB2) is a newly discovered autophagy receptor in the mitochondrial inner membrane, and its role in Parkinson's disease remains unclear. Protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is a factor that regulates cell fate during endoplasmic reticulum stress. Parkin is regulated by PERK and is a target of the unfolded protein response. It is unclear whether PERK regulates PHB2-mediated mitophagy through Parkin. In this study, we established a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We used adeno-associated virus to knockdown PHB2 expression. Our results showed that loss of dopaminergic neurons and motor deficits were aggravated in the MPTP-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Overexpression of PHB2 inhibited these abnormalities. We also established a 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP+)-induced SH-SY5Y cell model of Parkinson's disease. We found that overexpression of Parkin increased co-localization of PHB2 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, and promoted mitophagy. In addition, MPP+ regulated Parkin involvement in PHB2-mediated mitophagy through phosphorylation of PERK. These findings suggest that PHB2 participates in the development of Parkinson's disease by interacting with endoplasmic reticulum stress and Parkin.
