PMID: 37809151

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurological ailments. With diverse motor affectations (postural instability, resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity), people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) have a broad spectrum of non-motor symptoms. These include autonomic function changes, cognitive deterioration, neuropsychiatric difficulties, and sleep interruptions. Psychological disturbances, such as anxiety and sadness, are common among PwP. This discomfort is often accompanied by a decrease in general functioning, both at work and in social contacts. Furthermore, people who are experiencing psychological distress have a quick decrease in both physical and cognitive capacities. Furthermore, Pwp who also suffer from anxiety and depression are more likely to acquire dementia. It is worth noting that studies have shown good outcomes in the treatment of physical disabilities in PWP and the various therapeutics available for each affected body part, such as in the legs when they have walking problems, resting tremor in their hands, or micrography, which is a common symptom in these patients. The medical research databases PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were used to look for relevant materials. Upon meticulous scrutiny, a thorough investigation was conducted on the papers at hand. A total of 10 publications were meticulously selected based on stringent qualifying criteria. The present investigation examines various perspectives regarding the physical rehabilitation of individuals diagnosed with PD. The majority of therapeutic interventions employed revolve around cutting-edge technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), combined with exercise regimens. These interventions have demonstrated notable statistical significance in terms of enhancing various physical aspects, including endurance, performance, gait capacity, perception, and overall independence in daily life activities. One of the gathered studies makes use of the therapeutic benefits of yoga to help PwP deal with their anxiety and improve their mental health. Based on the aforementioned information, further investigation is required to ascertain the optimal approach for physical rehabilitation management and develop diverse strategies aimed at assisting individuals with PD in attaining physical autonomy.
