Title: A new regulator of autophagy initiation in glia.
PMID: 37615623

Abstract:
Macroautophagy/autophagy is the major degradation pathway in neurons for eliminating damaged proteins and organelles in Parkinson disease (PD). Like neurons, glial cells are important contributors to PD, yet how autophagy is executed in glia and whether it is using similar interplay as in neurons or other tissues, remain largely elusive. Recently, we reported that the PD risk factor, GAK/aux (cyclin-G-associated kinase/auxilin), regulates the onset of glial autophagy. In the absence of GAK/aux, the number and size of the autophagosomes and autophagosomal precursors increase in adult fly glia and mouse microglia. The protein levels of components in the initiation and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) complexes are generally upregulated. GAK/aux interacts with the master initiation regulator ULK1/Atg1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) via its uncoating domain, hinders autophagy activation by competing with ATG13 (autophagy related 13) for binding to the ULK1 C terminus, and regulates ULK1 trafficking to phagophores. Nonetheless, lack of GAK/aux impairs the autophagic flux and blocks substrate degradation, suggesting that GAK/aux might play additional roles. Overall, our findings reveal a new regulator of autophagy initiation in glia, advancing our understanding on how glia contribute to PD in terms of eliminating pathological protein aggregates.<b>Abbreviations:</b> ATG13: autophagy related 13; GAK/aux: cyclin G associated kinase/auxilin; PtdIns3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PD: Parkinson disease; ULK1/Atg1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1.
