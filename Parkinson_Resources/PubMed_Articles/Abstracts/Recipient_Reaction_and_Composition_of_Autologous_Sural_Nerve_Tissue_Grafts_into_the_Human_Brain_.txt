Title: Recipient Reaction and Composition of Autologous Sural Nerve Tissue Grafts into the Human Brain.
PMID: 37834764

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe neurological disease for which there is no effective treatment or cure, and therefore it remains an unmet need in medicine. We present data from four participants who received autologous transplantation of small pieces of sural nerve tissue into either the basal forebrain containing the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) or the midbrain substantia nigra (SN). The grafts did not exhibit significant cell death or severe host-tissue reaction up to 55 months post-grafting and contained peripheral cells. Dopaminergic neurites showed active growth in the graft area and into the graft in the SN graft, and cholinergic neurites were abundant near the graft in the NBM. These results provide a histological basis for changes in clinical features after autologous peripheral nerve tissue grafting into the NBM or SN in PD.
