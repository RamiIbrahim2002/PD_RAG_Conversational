Title: Topological analysis of functional connectivity in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37680970

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder, which mainly affects patients' motor and non-motor function. Functional connectivity was preliminary explored and studied through resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Through the topological analysis of 54 PD scans and 31 age-matched normal controls (NC) in the Neurocon dataset, leveraging on rsfMRI data, the brain functional connection and the Vietoris-Rips (VR) complex were constructed. The barcodes of the complex were calculated to reflect the changes of functional connectivity neural circuits (FCNC) in brain network. The 0-dimensional Betti number <i>β<sub>0</sub></i> means the number of connected branches in VR complex. The average number of connected branches in PD group was greater than that in NC group when the threshold <i>δ</i> ≤ 0.7. Two-sample Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test and false discovery rate (FDR) correction were used for statistical analysis to investigate the FCNC changes between PD and NC groups. In PD group, under threshold of 0.7, the number of FCNC involved was significantly differences and these brain regions include the Cuneus_R, Lingual_R, Fusiform_R and Heschl_R. There are also significant differences in brain regions in the Frontal_Inf_Orb_R and Pallidum_R, when the threshold increased to 0.8 and 0.9 (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In addition, when the length of FCNC was medium, there was a significant statistical difference between the PD group and the NC group in the Neurocon dataset and the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Topological analysis based on rsfMRI data may provide comprehensive information about the changes of FCNC and may provide an alternative for clinical differential diagnosis.
