Title: Cranial geometry in patients with dystonia and Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37420081

Abstract:
Abnormal skull shape has been reported in brain disorders. However, no studies have investigated cranial geometry in neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to evaluate the cranial geometry of patients with dystonia or Parkinson's disease (PD). Cranial computed tomography images of 36 patients each with idiopathic dystonia (IDYS), PD, and chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) were analyzed. Those with IDYS had a significantly higher occipital index (OI) than those with CSDH (p = 0.014). When cephalic index (CI) was divided into the normal and abnormal groups, there was a significant difference between those with IDYS and CSDH (p = 0.000, α = 0.017) and between PD and CSDH (p = 0.031, α = 0.033). The age of onset was significantly correlated with the CI of IDYS (τ = - 0.282, p = 0.016). The Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale motor score (BFMDRS-M) showed a significant correlation with OI in IDYS (τ = 0.372, p = 0.002). The cranial geometry of patients with IDYS was significantly different from that of patients with CSDH. There was a significant correlation between age of onset and CI, as well as between BFMDRS-M and OI, suggesting that short heads in the growth phase and skull balance might be related to the genesis of dystonia and its effect on motor symptoms.
