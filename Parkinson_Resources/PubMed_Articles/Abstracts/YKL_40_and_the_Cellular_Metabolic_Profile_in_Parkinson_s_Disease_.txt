Title: YKL-40 and the Cellular Metabolic Profile in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 38003487

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. A growing body of evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation play a crucial role as a pathogenetic mechanism in PD. The glycoprotein YKL-40 (CHI3L1) is a potential biomarker involved in inflammation and tumor processes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the metabolic profile of PBMCs from PD patients and to search for a possible relationship between cellular bioenergetics and YKL-40. The study included 18 na√Øve PD patients and an age-matched control group (HC, n = 7). Patients were diagnosed according to the MDS-PD, the UPDRS, and the Hoen-Yahr scales. Mitochondrial activity was measured by a metabolic analyzer on isolated PBMCs from PD patients. Gene (qPCR) and protein (ELISA) expression levels of YKL40 were investigated. New data are reported revealing changes in the mitochondrial activity and YKL-40 levels in PD patients. Bioenergetic parameters showed increased respiratory reserve capacity in PD compared to HC. The protein levels of YKL-40 were threefold higher in PD. We found a correlation between the YKL-40 protein levels and basal respiration and between YKL-40 and ATP production. These observations suggest an interplay between YKL-40 and mitochondrial function in PD. We assume that the YKL-40 gene and protein levels in combination with changes in mitochondrial function might serve as an additional tool to monitor the clinical course of PD.
