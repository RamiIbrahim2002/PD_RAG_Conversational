Title: Correlation between 25-hydroxy-vitamin D and Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38318343

Abstract:
Previous cross-sectional studies have shown that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations than controls. Other studies have not yet tested whether research findings from other regions are generalizable to Chinese populations. In this case-control study, we examined the correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and Parkinson's disease.
