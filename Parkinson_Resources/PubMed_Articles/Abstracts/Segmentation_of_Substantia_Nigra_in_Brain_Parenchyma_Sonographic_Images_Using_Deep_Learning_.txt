Title: Segmentation of Substantia Nigra in Brain Parenchyma Sonographic Images Using Deep Learning.
PMID: 38276318

Abstract:
Currently, Parkinson's Disease (PD) is diagnosed primarily based on symptoms by experts clinicians. Neuroimaging exams represent an important tool to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Among them, Brain Parenchyma Sonography (BPS) is used to evaluate the hyperechogenicity of Substantia Nigra (SN), found in more than 90% of PD patients. In this article, we exploit a new dataset of BPS images to investigate an automatic segmentation approach for SN that can increase the accuracy of the exam and its practicability in clinical routine. This study achieves state-of-the-art performance in SN segmentation of BPS images. Indeed, it is found that the modified U-Net network scores a Dice coefficient of 0.859 Â± 0.037. The results presented in this study demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of SN automatic segmentation in BPS medical images, to the point that this study can be considered as the first stage of the development of an end-to-end CAD (Computer Aided Detection) system. Furthermore, the used dataset, which will be further enriched in the future, has proven to be very effective in supporting the training of CNNs and may pave the way for future studies in the field of CAD applied to PD.
