PMID: 37423520

Abstract:
Buyang Huanwu decoction (BHD), a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, was first recorded in Qing Dynasty physician Qingren Wang's Yi Lin Gai Cuo. BHD has been widely utilized in the treatment of patients with neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In particular, little is known about the role of gut microbiota.
