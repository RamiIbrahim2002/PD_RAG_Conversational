Title: New horizons in Parkinson's disease in older populations.
PMID: 37847793

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Ageing is considered to be the greatest risk factor for PD, with a complex interplay between genetics and the environment. With population ageing, the prevalence of PD is expected to escalate worldwide; thus, it is of utmost importance to reduce the burden of PD. To date, there are no therapies to cure the disease, and current treatment strategies focus on the management of symptoms. Older adults often have multiple chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes, which further complicates the management of PD. Healthcare systems and care models necessary to address the broad needs of older PD patients are largely unavailable. In this New Horizon article, we discuss various aspects of PD from an ageing perspective, including disease management. We highlight recent advancements in PD therapies and discuss new care models with the potential to improve patient's quality of life.
