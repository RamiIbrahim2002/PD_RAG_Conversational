PMID: 37772286

Abstract:
Driving is a complex, everyday task that impacts patient agency, safety, mobility, social connections, and quality of life. Digital tools can provide comprehensive real-world (RW) data on driver behavior in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), providing critical data on disease status and treatment efficacy in the patient's own environment.
