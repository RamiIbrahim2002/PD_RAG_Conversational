Abstract:
Communication of people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) is negatively affected. For PwPD with communication difficulties, it is important to use self-assessment tools as a primary assessment approach to evaluate their perspectives on communication. It is also important to evaluate PwPDs with self-assessment scales in order to determine in which situations their communicative effectiveness is affected and to include them in the intervention plan.
