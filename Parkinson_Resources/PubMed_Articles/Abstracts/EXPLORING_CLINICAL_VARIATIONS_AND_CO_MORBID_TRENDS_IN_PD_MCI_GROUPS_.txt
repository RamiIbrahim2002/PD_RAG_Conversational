PMID: 38096535

Abstract:
Parkinson's Disease in Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI) is a complex condition characterized by a variety of cognitive problems that coexist with the physical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aims to examine the different medical indicators and associated tendencies among different PD-MCI groups. We investigated 132 people who had been given PD-MCI diagnoses. Utilizing SPSS, statistical evaluations are carried out. In overall PD-MCI variants, this investigation found that visuospatial ability and attentional/executive performance are the most impaired cognitive areas. It was also noticed that distinct PD-MCI groups had variances in their neurological characteristics, in multi domain amnesia (Non-Memory) PD-MCI patients exhibiting especially severe issues with unstable posture and walking. The intricacy of PD- Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is highlighted by those results, which also imply that the interplay between mental and physical signs may be controlled by a number of interrelated factors, such as particular cognitive areas, brain surfaces, and the general level of cognitive impairment.
