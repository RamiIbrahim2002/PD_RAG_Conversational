Title: Dopamine Transporter Scan (DAT) in Parkinsonism - a Short Review for Non-Neurologists.
PMID: 37643339

Abstract:
The Dopamine Transporter Scan (DaT) is a radionuclear imaging technique which was approved by the FDA to differentiate essential tremor (ET) from Parkinson's disease (PD). The scan is a crude indicator of the number of dopamine-secreting cells and is abnormal in presynaptic parkinsonian syndromes. In this article we review this and other possible clinical situations in which a DaT scan may be useful.
