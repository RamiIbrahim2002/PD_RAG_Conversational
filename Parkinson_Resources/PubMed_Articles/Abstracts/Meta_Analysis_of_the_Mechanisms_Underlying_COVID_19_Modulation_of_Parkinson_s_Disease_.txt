Title: Meta-Analysis of the Mechanisms Underlying COVID-19 Modulation of Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37686360

Abstract:
Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus enters host cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), leading to systemic inflammation, also known as a "cytokine storm", and neuroinflammation. COVID-19's upstream regulator, interferon-gamma (IFNG), is downregulated upon the infection of SARS-CoV-2, which leads to the downregulation of ACE2. The neuroinflammation signaling pathway (NISP) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which is characterized by the formation of Lewy bodies made primarily of the Î±-synuclein protein encoded by the <i>synuclein alpha</i> (<i>SNCA</i>) gene. We hypothesize that COVID-19 may modulate PD progression through neuroinflammation induced by cytokine storms. This study aimed to elucidate the possible mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in COVID-19-triggered pathology associated with neurodegenerative diseases like PD. This study presents the analysis of the pathways involved in the downregulation of ACE2 following SARS-CoV-2 infection and its effect on PD progression. Through QIAGEN's Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), the study identified the NISP as a top-five canonical pathway/signaling pathway and <i>SNCA</i> as a top-five upstream regulator. Core Analysis was also conducted on the associated molecules between COVID-19 and <i>SNCA</i> to construct a network connectivity map. The Molecule Activity Predictor tool was used to simulate the infection of SARS-CoV-2 by downregulating IFNG, which leads to the predicted activation of <i>SNCA</i>, and subsequently PD, through a dataset of intermediary molecules. Downstream effect analysis was further used to quantify the downregulation of ACE2 on <i>SNCA</i> activation.
