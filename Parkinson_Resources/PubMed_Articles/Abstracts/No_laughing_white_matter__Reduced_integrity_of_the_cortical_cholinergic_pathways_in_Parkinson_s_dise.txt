Title: No laughing white matter: Reduced integrity of the cortical cholinergic pathways in Parkinson's disease-related cognitive impairment.
PMID: 37524210

Abstract:
Approximately one third of recently diagnosed Parkinson's disease (PD) patients experience cognitive decline. The nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) degenerates early in PD and is crucial for cognitive function. The two main NBM white matter pathways include a lateral and medial trajectory. However, research is needed to determine which pathway, if any, are associated with PD-related cognitive decline.
