PMID: 37976909

Cognitive decline is a common but variable non-motor manifestation of Parkinson's disease. Chronic liver disease contributes to dementia, but its impact on cognitive performance in Parkinson's disease is unknown. We assessed the effect of liver fibrosis on cognition in Parkinson's disease.
