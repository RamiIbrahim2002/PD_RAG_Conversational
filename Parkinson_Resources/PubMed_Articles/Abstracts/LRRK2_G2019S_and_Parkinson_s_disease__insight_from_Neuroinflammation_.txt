Title: LRRK2 G2019S and Parkinson's disease: insight from Neuroinflammation.
PMID: 37777187

Abstract:
The multiple hypothesis holds that the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) requires many factors such as heredity, environment and ageing. Mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are recognized the risk factors of PD, and closely related to sporadic and familial PD and can regulate a variety of cellular pathways and processes. An Increasing number of studies has shown that glial hyperactivation-mediated neuroinflammation participates in dopaminergic neuron degeneration and pathogenesis of PD. LRRK2 is essential to the regulaton of chronic inflammation, especially for the central nervous system. The review spotlights on the novel development of LRRK2 on microglia and astrocytes, and explore their potential therapeutic targets, in order to provide a new insights in PD. Key messages: What is already known on this topic The G2019S mutation of LRRK2 is now recognised as a pathogenic mutation in PD. Previous studies have focused on the relationship between neurons and LRRK2 G2019S. What this study adds Neuroinflammation mediated by LRRK2 G2019S of glial cells affects the progress and development of PD and attention must be paid to the role of LRRK2 G2019S in glial cells in PD. How this study might affect research, practice or policy Developing anti-inflammatory drugs from the perspective of LRRK2 G2019S of glial cells is a new direction for the treatment of PD.
