Abstract:
There is growing interest in the use of natural products for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Mucuna pruriens has been used in the treatment of humans with PD. The goal of this study was to determine if daily oral treatment with an extract of Mucuna pruriens, starting after the MPTP-induced loss of nigrostriatal dopamine in male mice, would result in recovery/restoration of motor function, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein expression in the nigrostriatal pathway, or glutamate biomarkers in both the striatum and motor cortex. Following MPTP administration, resulting in an 80Â % loss of striatal TH, treatment with Mucuna pruriens failed to rescue either striatal TH or the dopamine transporter back to the control levels, but there was restoration of gait/motor function. There was an MPTP-induced loss of TH-labeled neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and in the number of striatal dendritic spines, both of which failed to be recovered following treatment with Mucuna pruriens. This Mucuna pruriens-induced locomotor recovery following MPTP was associated with restoration of two striatal glutamate transporter proteins, GLAST (EAAT1) and EAAC1 (EAAT3), and the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) within the motor cortex. Post-MPTP treatment with Mucuna pruriens, results in locomotor improvement that is associated with recovery of striatal and motor cortex glutamate transporters but is independent of nigrostriatal TH restoration.
