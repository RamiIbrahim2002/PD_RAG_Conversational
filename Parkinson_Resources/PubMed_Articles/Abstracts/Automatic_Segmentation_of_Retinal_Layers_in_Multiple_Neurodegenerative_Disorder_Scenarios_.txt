Title: Automatic Segmentation of Retinal Layers in Multiple Neurodegenerative Disorder Scenarios.
PMID: 37682646

Abstract:
Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) allows the non-invasive direct observation of the central nervous system, enabling the measurement and extraction of biomarkers from neural tissue that can be helpful in the assessment of ocular, systemic and Neurological Disorders (ND). Deep learning models can be trained to segment the retinal layers for biomarker extraction. However, the onset of ND can have an impact on the neural tissue, which can lead to the degraded performance of models not exposed to images displaying signs of disease during training. We present a fully automatic approach for the retinal layer segmentation in multiple neurodegenerative disorder scenarios, using an annotated dataset of patients of the most prevalent NDs: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and essential tremor, along with healthy control patients. Furthermore, we present a two-part, comprehensive study on the effects of ND on the performance of these models. The results show that images of healthy patients may not be sufficient for the robust training of automated segmentation models intended for the analysis of ND patients, and that using images representative of different NDs can increase the model performance. These results indicate that the presence or absence of patients of ND in datasets should be taken into account when training deep learning models for retinal layer segmentation, and that the proposed approach can provide a valuable tool for the robust and reliable diagnosis in multiple scenarios of ND.
