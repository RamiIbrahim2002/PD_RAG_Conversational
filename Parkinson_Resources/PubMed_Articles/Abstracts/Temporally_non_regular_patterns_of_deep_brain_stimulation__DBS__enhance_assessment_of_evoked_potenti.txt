Title: Temporally non-regular patterns of deep brain stimulation (DBS) enhance assessment of evoked potentials while maintaining motor symptom management in Parkinson's disease (PD).
PMID: 37863388

Abstract:
Traditional deep brain stimulation (DBS) at fixed regular frequencies (>100Â Hz) is effective in treating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Temporally non-regular patterns of DBS are a new parameter space that may help increase efficacy and efficiency.
