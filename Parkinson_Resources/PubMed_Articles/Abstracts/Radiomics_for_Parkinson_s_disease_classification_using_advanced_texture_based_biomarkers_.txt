PMID: 37791007

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the neurodegenerative diseases and its manual diagnosis leads to time-consuming process. MRI-based computer-aided diagnosis helps medical experts to diagnose PD more precisely and fast. Texture-based radiomic analysis is carried out on 3D MRI scans of T1 weighted and resting-state modalities. 43 subjects from Neurocon and 40 subjects from Tao-Wu dataset were examined, which consisted of 36 scans of healthy controls and 47 scans of Parkinson's patients. Total 360 2D MRI images are selected among around 17000 slices of T1-weighted and resting scans of selected 72 subjects. Local binary pattern (LBP) method was applied with custom variants to acquire advanced textural biomarkers from MRI images. LBP histogram helped to learn discriminative local patterns to detect and classify Parkinson's disease. Using recursive feature elimination, data dimensions of around 150-300 LBP histogram features were reduced to 13-21 most significant features based on score, and important features were analysed using SVM and random forest algorithms. Variant-I of LBP has performed well with highest test accuracy of 83.33%, precision of 84.62%, recall of 91.67%, and f1-score of 88%. Classification accuracies were obtained from 61.11% to 83.33% and AUC-ROC values range from 0.43 to 0.86 using four variants of LBP.•Parkinson's classification is carried out using an advanced biomedical texture feature. Texture extraction using four variants of uniform, rotation invariant LBP method is performed for radiomic analysis of Parkinson's disorder.•Proposed method with support vector machine classifier is experimented and an accuracy of 83.33% is achieved with 10-fold cross validation for detection of Parkinson's patients from MRI-based radiomic analysis.•The proposed predictive model has proved the potential of textures of extended version of LBP, which have demonstrated subtle variations in local appearance for Parkinson's detection.
