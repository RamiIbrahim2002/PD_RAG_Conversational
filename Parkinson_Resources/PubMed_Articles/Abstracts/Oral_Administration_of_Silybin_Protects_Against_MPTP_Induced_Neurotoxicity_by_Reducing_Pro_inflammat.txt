Title: Oral Administration of Silybin Protects Against MPTP-Induced Neurotoxicity by Reducing Pro-inflammatory Cytokines and Preserving BDNF Levels in Mice.
PMID: 37480498

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease associated with motor dysfunction secondary to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal axis. Actual therapy consists mainly of levodopa; however, its long-term use promotes secondary effects. Consequently, finding new therapeutic alternatives, such as neuroprotective molecules, is necessary. Among these alternatives is silybin (Sb), the major bioactive flavonolignan in silymarin. Both exert neuroprotective effects, preserving dopamine levels and dopaminergic neurons when administered in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse PD model, being probably Sb the potential therapeutic molecule behind this effect. To elucidate the role of Sb in the PD model, we determined the dose-dependent conservation of striatal dopamine content following Sb oral administration. Then, we evaluated motor deficit tests using the best dopamine conservative dose of Sb and determined a cytokine-dependent inflammatory profile status, malondialdehyde as an oxidative stress product, and neurotrophic factors content in the MPTP-induced mouse PD model. Our results show that oral Sb at 100 mg/kg dose conserved about 60% dopamine levels. Also, Sb improved motor deficits, preserved neurotrophic factors content and mitochondrial function, reduced lipid peroxidation, diminished proinflammatory cytokines to basal levels, enhanced fractalkine production in the striatum and substantia nigra, and increased IL-10 and IL-4 levels in the substantia nigra in the MPTP mice. Thus, oral Sb may be a potential pharmacological PD treatment alternative.
