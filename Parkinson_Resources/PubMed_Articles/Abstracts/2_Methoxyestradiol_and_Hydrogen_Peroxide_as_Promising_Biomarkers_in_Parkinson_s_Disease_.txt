Title: 2-Methoxyestradiol and Hydrogen Peroxide as Promising Biomarkers in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37589832

Abstract:
Estrogens function in numerous physiological processes including controlling brain cell growth and differentiation. 2-Methoxestradiol (2-ME2), a 17β-estradiol (E2) metabolite, is known for its anticancer effects as observed both in vivo and in vitro. 2-ME2 affects all actively dividing cells, including neurons. The study aimed to determine whether 2-ME2 is a potentially cancer-protective or rather neurodegenerative agent in a specific tissue culture model as well as a clinical setup. In this study, 2-ME2 activity was determined in a Parkinson's disease (PD) in vitro model based on the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. The obtained results suggest that 2-ME2 generates nitro-oxidative stress and controls heat shock proteins (HSP), resulting in DNA strand breakage and apoptosis. On the one hand, it may affect intensely dividing cells preventing cancer development; however, on the other hand, this kind of activity within the central nervous system may promote neurodegenerative diseases like PD. Thus, the translational value of 2-ME2's neurotoxic activity in a PD in vitro model was also investigated. LC-MS/MS technique was used to evaluate estrogens and their derivatives, namely, hydroxy and methoxyestrogens, in PD patients' blood, whereas the stopped-flow method was used to assess hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) levels. Methoxyestrogens and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were increased in patients' blood as compared to control subjects, but hydoxyestrogens were simultaneously decreased. From the above, we suggest that the determination of plasma levels of methoxyestrogens and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> may be a novel PD biomarker. The presented research is the subject of the pending patent application "The use of hydrogen peroxide and 17β-estradiol and its metabolites as biomarkers in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases," no.
