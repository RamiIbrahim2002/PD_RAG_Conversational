Title: Tetramic acid-motif natural products from a marine fungus <i>Tolypocladium cylindrosporum</i> FB06 and their anti-Parkinson activities.
PMID: 38433962

Abstract:
Tetramic acid-containing natural products are attracting significantly increasing attention from biologists and chemists due to their intriguing structures and biological activities. In the present study, two new tetramic acid alkaloids tolypyridone I (<b>1</b>) and tolypyridone J (<b>2</b>), together with five known ones (<b>3</b>-<b>7</b>), were isolated from cultures of a marine fungus <i>Tolypocladium cylindrosporum</i> FB06 isolate obtained from a marine sediment in Beaufort sea of North Alaska. Their structures were elucidated using 1D, 2D NMR, and HRESIMS. Their configurations were established on the basis of <sup>1</sup>H coupling constants, ROESY correlations and DP4 calculations. Compound <b>2</b> was isolated as mixtures of rotational isomers with C-3 to C-7 axis between 4-hydroxy-2-pyridone and 1-ethyl-3,5-dimethylcyclohexane, hindering rotation. In our unbiased screening to discover neuroprotective compounds in an in vitro Parkinson's disease (PD) model, SH-SY5Y dopaminergic cells were treated with isolated compounds followed by treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>), a parkinsonian neurotoxin. Among tested compounds, F-14329 (<b>7</b>) significantly protected cells from MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced cytotoxicity. MPP<sup>+</sup>-mediated cell death is known to be related to the regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, specifically the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax levels. Treatment with 2 mmol/L of MPP<sup>+</sup> for 24 h significantly reduced Bcl-2 levels compared to control treated with vehicle. However, treatment with F-14329 (<b>7</b>) attenuated such reduction. This study demonstrates that tetramic acid-motif compounds could be potential lead compounds for treating PD.
