Title: Imaging Interstitial Fluid With MRI: A Narrative Review on the Associations of Altered Interstitial Fluid With Vascular and Neurodegenerative Abnormalities.
PMID: 37823526

Abstract:
Interstitial fluid (ISF) refers to the fluid between the parenchymal cells and along the perivascular spaces (PVS). ISF plays a crucial role in delivering nutrients and clearing waste products from the brain. This narrative review focuses on the use of MRI techniques to measure various ISF characteristics in humans. The complementary value of contrast-enhanced and noncontrast-enhanced techniques is highlighted. While contrast-enhanced MRI methods allow measurement of ISF transport and flow, they lack quantitative assessment of ISF properties. Noninvasive MRI techniques, including multi-b-value diffusion imaging, free-water-imaging, T<sub>2</sub>-decay imaging, and DTI along the PVS, offer promising alternatives to derive ISF measures, such as ISF volume and diffusivity. The emerging role of these MRI techniques in investigating ISF alterations in neurodegenerative diseases (eg, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) and cerebrovascular diseases (eg, cerebral small vessel disease and stroke) is discussed. This review also emphasizes current challenges of ISF imaging, such as the microscopic scale at which ISF has to be measured, and discusses potential focus points for future research to overcome these challenges, for example, the use of high-resolution imaging techniques. Noninvasive MRI methods for measuring ISF characteristics hold significant potential and may have a high clinical impact in understanding the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disorders, as well as in evaluating the efficacy of ISF-targeted therapies in clinical trials.
