Title: Neural functional network of early Parkinson's disease based on independent component analysis.
PMID: 37746803

Abstract:
This work explored neural network changes in early Parkinson's disease: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate functional alterations in different stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). Ninety-five PD patients (50 early/mild and 45 early/moderate) and 37 healthy controls (HCs) were included. Independent component analysis revealed significant differences in intra-network connectivity, specifically in the default mode network (DMN) and right frontoparietal network (RFPN), in both PD groups compared to HCs. Inter-network connectivity analysis showed reduced connectivity between the executive control network (ECN) and DMN, as well as ECN-left frontoparietal network (LFPN), in early/mild PD. Early/moderate PD exhibited decreased connectivity in ECN-LFPN, ECN-RFPN, ECN-DMN, and DMN-auditory network, along with increased connectivity in LFPN-cerebellar network. Correlations were found between ECN-DMN and ECN-LFPN connections with UPDRS-III scores in early/mild PD. These findings suggest that PD progression involves dysfunction in multiple intra- and inter-networks, particularly implicating the ECN, and a wider range of abnormal functional networks may mark the progression of the disease.
