Title: The Role of PKM2 in Multiple Signaling Pathways Related to Neurological Diseases.
PMID: 38157121

Abstract:
Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a key rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis. It is well known that PKM2 plays a vital role in the proliferation of tumor cells. However, PKM2 can also exert its biological functions by mediating multiple signaling pathways in neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), cognitive dysfunction, ischemic stroke, post-stroke depression, cerebral small-vessel disease, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and autoimmune diseases. In these diseases, PKM2 can exert various biological functions, including regulation of glycolysis, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, proliferation of cells, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, or pathological autoimmune responses. Moreover, the complexity of PKM2's biological characteristics determines the diversity of its biological functions. However, the role of PKM2 is not entirely the same in different diseases or cells, which is related to its oligomerization, subcellular localization, and post-translational modifications. This article will focus on the biological characteristics of PKM2, the regulation of PKM2 expression, and the biological role of PKM2 in neurological diseases. With this review, we hope to have a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PKM2, which may help researchers develop therapeutic strategies in clinic.
