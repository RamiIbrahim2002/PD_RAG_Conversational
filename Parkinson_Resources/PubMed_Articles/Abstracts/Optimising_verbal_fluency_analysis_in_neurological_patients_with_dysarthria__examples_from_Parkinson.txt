Title: Optimising verbal fluency analysis in neurological patients with dysarthria: examples from Parkinson's disease and hereditary ataxia.
PMID: 37656122

Abstract:
Verbal fluency tests (VFTs) are widely used to assess cognitive-linguistic performance in neurological diseases. However, the influence of dysarthria on performance in tests requiring oral responses is unclear in ataxia and Parkinson's disease.
