Title: Aberrant dentato-rubro-thalamic pathway in action tremor but not rest tremor: A multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging study.
PMID: 37408389

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to clarify the dentato-rubro-thalamic (DRT) pathway in action tremor in comparison to normal controls (NC) and disease controls (i.e., rest tremor) by using multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
