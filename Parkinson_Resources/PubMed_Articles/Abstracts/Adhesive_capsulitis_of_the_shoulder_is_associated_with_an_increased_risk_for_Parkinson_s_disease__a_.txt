Title: Adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder is associated with an increased risk for Parkinson's disease: a population-based longitudinal follow-up study.
PMID: 37428415

Abstract:
Previous studies have suggested a positive association between adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder (ACS) and Parkinson's disease (PD), but longitudinal data were lacking. The present population-based longitudinal follow-up study therefore investigated the risk of developing PD in patients with ACS.
