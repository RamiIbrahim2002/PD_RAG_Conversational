PMID: 37649209

Abstract:
Stem-cell-based therapeutics have shown immense potential in treating various diseases that are currently incurable. In particular, partial recovery of Parkinson's disease, which occurs due to massive loss or abnormal functionality of dopaminergic (DAnergic) neurons, through the engraftment of stem-cell-derived neurons ex vivo is reported. However, precise assessment of the functionality and maturity of DAnergic neurons is still challenging for their enhanced clinical efficacy. Here, a novel conductive cell cultivation platform, a graphene oxide (GO)-incorporated metallic polymer nanopillar array (GOMPON), that can electrochemically detect dopamine (DA) exocytosis from living DAnergic neurons, is reported. In the cell-free configuration, the linear range is 0.5-100 µm, with a limit of detection of 33.4 nm. Owing to its excellent biocompatibility, a model DAnergic neuron (SH-SY5Y cell) can be cultivated and differentiated on the platform while their DA release can be quantitatively measured in a real-time and nondestructive manner. Finally, it is showed that the functionality of the DAnergic neurons derived from stem cells can be precisely assessed via electrochemical detection of their DA exocytosis. The developed GOMPON is highly promising for a wide range of applications, including real-time monitoring of stem cell differentiation into neuronal lineages, evaluating differentiation protocols, and finding practical stem cell therapies.
