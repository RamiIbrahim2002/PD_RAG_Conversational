Title: Investigation of <i>PRKN</i> Mutations in Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia in Parkinson's Disease Treatment.
PMID: 37626726

Abstract:
Mitophagy is an important process that participates in mitochondrial quality control. Dysfunctions in this process can be caused by mutations in genes like <i>PRKN</i> and are associated with the development and progression of Parkinson's Disease (PD). The most used drug in the treatment of PD is levodopa (LD), but it can cause adverse effects, such as dyskinesia. Currently, few studies are searching for biomarkers for an effective use of lLD for this disease, especially regarding mitophagy genetics. Thus, this work investigates the association of 14 variants of the <i>PRKN</i> gene with LD in the treatment of PD. We recruited 70 patients with PD undergoing treatment with LD (39 without dyskinesia and 31 with dyskinesia). Genotyping was based on Sanger sequencing. Our results reinforce that age at onset of symptoms, duration of PD, and treatment and dosage of LD can influence the occurrence of dyskinesia but not the investigated <i>PRKN</i> variants. The perspective presented here of variants of mitophagy-related genes in the context of treatment with LD is still underexplored, although an association has been indicated in previous studies. We suggest that other variants in <i>PRKN</i> or in other mitophagy genes may participate in the development of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in PD treatment.
