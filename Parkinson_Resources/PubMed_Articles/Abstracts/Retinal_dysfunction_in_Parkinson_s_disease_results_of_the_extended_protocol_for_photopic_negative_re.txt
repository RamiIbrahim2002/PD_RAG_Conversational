Title: Retinal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease-results of the extended protocol for photopic negative response (PHNR) full-field electroretinogram (ERG).
PMID: 37515709

Abstract:
We investigated whether the photopic negative response (PhNR) in the electroretinogram (ERG) was affected in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and whether it was associated with retinal changes on optical coherence tomography (OCT).
