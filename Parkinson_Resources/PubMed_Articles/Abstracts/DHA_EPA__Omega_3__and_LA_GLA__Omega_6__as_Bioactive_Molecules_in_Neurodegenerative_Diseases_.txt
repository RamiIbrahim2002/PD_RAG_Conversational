Title: DHA/EPA (Omega-3) and LA/GLA (Omega-6) as Bioactive Molecules in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
PMID: 37445890

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by neuroinflammation, neuronal depletion and oxidative stress. They coincide with subtle chronic or flaring inflammation, sometimes escalating with infiltrations of the immune system cells in the inflamed parts causing mild to severe or even lethal damage. Thus, neurodegenerative diseases show all features of autoimmune diseases. Prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has dramatically increased in recent decades and unfortunately, the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of available drugs is moderate. The beneficial effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) are nowadays highlighted by a plethora of studies. They play a role in suppression of inflammation, gene expression, cellular membrane fluidity/permeability, immune functionality and intracellular/exocellular signaling. The role of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (LA), gamma linolenic acid (GLA), and arachidonic acid (AA), on neuroprotection is controversial, as some of these agents, specifically AA, are proinflammatory, whilst current data suggest that they may have neuroprotective properties as well. This review provides an overview of the existing recent clinical studies with respect to the role of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs as therapeutic agents in chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune neurodegenerative diseases as well as the dosages and the period used for testing.
