Title: Evaluation of Temporomandibular Joint in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: A Comparative Study.
PMID: 37568844

Abstract:
(1) The aim of this study was to perform an evaluation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and present the morphological differences of the TMJ between healthy subjects and patients with PD. (2) A total of 102 Caucasian subjects were divided equally into two groups. The study group consisted of patients with PD, while the control group comprised healthy subjects. Ten parameters, including anterior joint space (AJS), superior joint space (SJS), posterior joint space (PJS), condyle head length (CHL), condylar neck width (CNW), minor axis of the condyle (MAC), long axis of the condyle (LAC), condylar axis inclination (CI), medial joint space (MJS), and lateral joint space (LJS), were measured using magnetic resonance images. The data were statistically analyzed using paired samples <i>t</i>-test and Student's <i>t</i>-test, with a significance level set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. (3) In the PD group, all TMJ parameters showed a statistically significant difference between both sides of the face (<i>p</i> < 0.05). However, in the control group, AJS, SJS, PJS, CHL, CNW, MAC, CI, MJS, and LJS did not show a statistically significant difference between both sides of the face (<i>p</i> > 0.05), except for LAC (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The asymmetry index values of AJS, SJS, PJS, CHL, CNW, MAC, CI, MJS, and LJS demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the study and control groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05), except for LAC (<i>p</i> > 0.05). (4) Within the limitations of this retrospective study, the findings suggest that TMJ morphology and asymmetry could be associated with PD.
