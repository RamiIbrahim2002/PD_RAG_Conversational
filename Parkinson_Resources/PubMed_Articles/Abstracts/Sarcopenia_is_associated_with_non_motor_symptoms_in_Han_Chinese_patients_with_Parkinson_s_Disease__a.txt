PMID: 37587447

Abstract:
Sarcopenia is commonly seen in the older adults and increases in incidence with age, also in Parkinson's disease (PD). Although research has indicated that the development of sarcopenia in patients with PD may be related to both motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms (NMS), the precise relationship between the two conditions remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the incidence of sarcopenia in patients with PD and its association with NMS.
