Title: Central and peripheral innate and adaptive immunity in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37939158

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem disorder with characteristics of a chronic inflammatory disease. To develop effective immunomodulatory interventions to combat PD, we need to think innovatively about the implications of orchestrated central and peripheral innate and adaptive immune responses that occur as the disease begins and progresses.
