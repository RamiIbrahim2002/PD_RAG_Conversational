Title: Transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound pallidothalamic tractotomy for patients with X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism: a study protocol.
PMID: 37596524

Abstract:
Transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a noninvasive method for controlling tremor and has recently been used in patients with X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP). This study aims to determine the improvement in dystonia and parkinsonism in patients with XDP after MRgFUS pallidothalamic tractotomy. This prospective study will be conducted at the Philippine General Hospital, University of the Philippines Manila. The primary outcome measure is the change in the pre- and post-treatment XDP-Movement Disorder Society of the Philippines Scale scores. In addition, demographic and clinical data will be collected, including the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale, Part III of the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale score, XDP clinical and functional stage, the five-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores, MRgFUS treatment parameters, and adverse events. Patients will be assessed within 24Â hours of treatment, then at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months post-treatment. This protocol was approved by the University of the Philippines Manila Research Ethics Board (UPMREB 2022-0271-01). Data collection began in January 2023. This protocol has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov: Trial Registration number: NCT05592028.
