Title: Cross talk about the role of Neuropeptide Y in CNS disorders and diseases.
PMID: 37918268

Abstract:
A peptide composed of a 36 amino acid called Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is employed in a variety of physiological processes to manage and treat conditions affecting the endocrine, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, and neurological systems. NPY naturally binds to G-protein coupled receptors, activating the Y-receptors (Y1-Y5 and y6). The findings on numerous therapeutic applications of NPY for CNS disease are presented in this review by the authors. New targets for treating diseases will be revealed by medication combinations that target NPY and its receptors. This review is mainly focused on disorders such as anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Machado Joseph disease, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, depression, migraine, alcohol use disorder, and substance use disorder. The findings from the preclinical studies and clinical studies covered in this article may help create efficient therapeutic plans to treat neurological conditions on the one hand and psychiatric disorders on the other. They may also open the door to the creation of novel NPY receptor ligands as medications to treat these conditions.
