Title: New fraternine analogues: Evaluation of the antiparkinsonian effect in the model of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37984248

Abstract:
Venom-derived peptides are important sources for the development of new therapeutic molecules, especially due to their broad pharmacological activity. Previously, our research group identified a novel natural peptide, named fraternine, with promising effects for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In the present paper, we synthesized three peptides bioinspired in fraternine: fra-10, fra-14, and fra-24. They were tested in the 6-OHDA-induced model of parkinsonism, quantifying motor coordination, levels of TH+ neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN), and inflammation mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1ß in the cortex. Peptides fra-14 and fra-10 improved the motor coordination in relation to 6-OHDA lesioned animals. However, most of the peptides were toxic in the doses applied. All three peptides reduced the intensity of the lesion induced rotations in the apomorphine test. Fra-24 higher dose increased the number of TH+ neurons in SN and reduced the concentration of TNF-α in the cortex of 6-OHDA lesioned mice. Overall, only the peptide fra-24 presented a neuroprotection effect on dopaminergic neurons of SN and a reduction of cytokine TNF-α levels, making it worthy of consideration for the treatment of PD.
