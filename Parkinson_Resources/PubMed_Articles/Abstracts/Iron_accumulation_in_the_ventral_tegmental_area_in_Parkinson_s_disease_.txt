Title: Iron accumulation in the ventral tegmental area in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37448687

Abstract:
The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is less affected compared to substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate iron content in the VTA across different stages of PD in order to help explain the selective loss of dopamine neurons in PD.
