Title: Surface-Based Functional Alterations in Early-Onset and Late-Onset Parkinson's Disease: A Multi-Modal MRI Study.
PMID: 37761336

Abstract:
This study used a surface-based method to investigate brain functional alteration patterns in early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) and late-onset Parkinson's disease (LOPD) to provide more reliable imaging indicators for the assessment of the two subtypes. A total of 58 patients with Parkinson's disease were divided into two groups according to age at onset: EOPD (≤50 years; 16 males and 15 females) and LOPD (>50 years; 17 males and 10 females) groups. Two control groups were recruited from the community: young adults (YC; ≤50 years; 8 males and 19 females) and older adults (OC; >50 years; 12 males and 10 females). No significant differences were observed between the EOPD and YC groups or the LOPD and OC groups in terms of age, sex, education, and MMSE scores (<i>p</i> > 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed between the EOPD and LOPD groups in terms of education, H-Y scale, UPDRS score, or HAMD score (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Data preprocessing and surface-based regional homogeneity (2D-ReHo) calculations were subsequently performed using the MATLAB-based DPABIsurf software. The EOPD group showed decreased 2D-ReHo values in the left premotor area and right dorsal stream visual cortex, along with increased 2D-ReHo values in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In patients with LOPD, 2D-ReHo values were decreased in bilateral somatosensory and motor areas and the right paracentral lobular and mid-cingulate. The imaging characterization of surface-based regional changes may serve useful as monitoring indicators and will help to better understand the mechanisms underlying divergent clinical presentations.
