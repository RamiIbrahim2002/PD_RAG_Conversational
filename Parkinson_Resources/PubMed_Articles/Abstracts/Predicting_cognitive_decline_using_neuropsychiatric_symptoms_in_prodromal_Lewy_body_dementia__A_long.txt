Title: Predicting cognitive decline using neuropsychiatric symptoms in prodromal Lewy body dementia: A longitudinal study.
PMID: 37441886

Abstract:
Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Lewy body dementias (LBD) occur frequently and early in disease progression. Such symptoms are associated with worse quality of life, caregiver burden and functional limitations. Limited evidence exists, however, outlining the longitudinal relationship between NPS and cognitive decline in prodromal LBD.
