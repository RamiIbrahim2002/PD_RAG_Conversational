Title: Association between the blood pressure variability and cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37969048

Abstract:
High visit-to-visit blood pressure variability (BPV) was found to be associated with cognitive decline in the elderly. This study aimed to investigate the impact of visit-to-visit BPV on cognition in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD).
