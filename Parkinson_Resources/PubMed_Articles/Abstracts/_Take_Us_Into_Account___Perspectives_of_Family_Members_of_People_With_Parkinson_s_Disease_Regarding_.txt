Title: "Take Us Into Account": Perspectives of Family Members of People With Parkinson's Disease Regarding Speech-Language Pathology Intervention.
PMID: 38092050

Abstract:
While communication changes associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been documented, research on the impact of these changes on family members is just beginning to emerge. With this new focus on family, questions arise as to how well speech-language pathology services address their needs communicating with their loved one with PD. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of family members of people with PD (PwPD) and their recommendations for speech-language pathology services that incorporated their needs.
