Title: Tau in Atypical Parkinsonisms: A Meta-Analysis of in Vivo PET Imaging Findings.
PMID: 38094644

Abstract:
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) are atypical parkinsonisms (APs) that are classified as tauopathies. Patients with these APs may present with similar early clinical manifestations to Parkinson's disease (PD), but they prove unresponsive to anti-parkinsonian medications.
