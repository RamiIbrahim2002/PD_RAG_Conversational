Title: Visual and vestibular integration in Parkinson's disease while walking.
PMID: 37866253

Abstract:
Postural control requires effective sensory integration. People with Parkinson's disease (PD) are reported to have impaired visual and vestibular perception. While self-motion perception is a key aspect of locomotion, visual-vestibular integration has not been directly characterized in people with PD during gait. We compared the ability of people with PD and healthy older adults (OA) to integrate multi-sensory information during straight-line walking in response to visual and vestibular perturbations, using continuous translations of the visual surround and galvanic vestibular stimulation within a virtual reality environment. We measured their endpoint deviations from midline and changes in gait parameters. We found that people with PD deviated more than OA when walking in a dark environment but did not show differences in deviations when walking in a virtual room with visual information. With visual and vestibular perturbations, people with PD did not differ from OA in endpoint deviations nor variabilities. However, people with PD did not adopt a more cautious gait when GVS was applied in a virtual room, unlike OA. Overall, we showed that people with mild PD did not perform worse than OA but did show differences in gait patterns, suggesting that visual-vestibular integration is relatively preserved during gait in PD.
