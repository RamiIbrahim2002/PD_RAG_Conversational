Title: Theory of mind in mild cognitive impairment and Parkinson's disease: The role of memory impairment.
PMID: 38049608

Abstract:
Social cognition is impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD). Whether social cognitive impairment (iSC) is a by-product of the underlying cognitive deficits in PD or a process independent of cognitive status is unknown. To this end, the present study was designed to investigate the weight of specific cognitive deficits in social cognition, considering different mild cognitive impairment subtypes of PD (PD-MCI).
