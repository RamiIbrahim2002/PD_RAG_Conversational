Abstract:
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta with a reduction in dopamine concentration in the striatum. It is a substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons that is responsible for the classic triad of PD symptoms, i.e., resting tremor, muscular rigidity, and bradykinesia. Several current therapies for PD may only offer symptomatic relief and do not address the underlying neurodegeneration of PD. The recent developments in cellular reprogramming have enabled the development of previously unachievable cell therapies and patient-specific modeling of PD through Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs). iPSCs possess the inherent capacity for pluripotency, allowing for their directed differentiation into diverse cell lineages, such as dopaminergic neurons, thus offering a promising avenue for addressing the issue of neurodegeneration within the context of PD. This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of dopamine on PD patients, illustrates the versatility of iPSCs and their regenerative abilities, and examines the benefits of using iPSC treatment for PD as opposed to current therapeutic measures. In means of providing a treatment approach that reinforces the long-term survival of the transplanted neurons, the review covers three supplementary avenues to reinforce the potential of iPSCs.
