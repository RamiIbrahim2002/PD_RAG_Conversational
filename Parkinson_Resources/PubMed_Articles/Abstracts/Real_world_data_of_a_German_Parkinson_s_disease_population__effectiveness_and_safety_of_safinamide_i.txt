PMID: 37421634

Abstract:
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to an imbalance of various neurotransmitters and affects cognitive, motor and non-motor function. Safinamide inhibits monoamine oxidase B in a highly selective and reversible manner and beyond that has anti-glutamatergic properties, with positive effects on motor and non-motor symptoms. The aim of the study was to obtain data about the effectiveness and tolerability of safinamide under routine clinical practice conditions in unselected patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
