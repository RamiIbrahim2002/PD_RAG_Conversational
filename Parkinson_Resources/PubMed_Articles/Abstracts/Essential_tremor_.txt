Title: Essential tremor.
PMID: 37620080

Abstract:
Essential tremor (ET) is a chronic and progressive neurologic disease. Its central and defining clinical feature is a 4-12Hz kinetic tremor, that is, tremor that occurs during voluntary movements such as drinking from a cup or writing. Patients may also exhibit a range of other tremors-postural, rest, intention, additional motor features (e.g., mild gait ataxia, mild dystonia), as well as nonmotor features. The disease itself seems to be a risk factor for other degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Both genetic and toxic environmental factors have been explored as etiologic factors. In addition to a growing appreciation of the presence of clinical, etiologic, and pathologic heterogeneity, there is some support for the notion that ET itself may not be a single disease, but may be a family of diseases whose central defining feature is kinetic tremor of the arms, and which might more accurately be referred to as "the essential tremors." Recent research has increasingly placed the seat of the disease in the cerebellum and cerebellar system and identified a host of neurodegenerative changes within the cerebellum, indicating that this progressive disorder is likely degenerative.
