Title: Testing for Allele-specific Expression from Human Brain Samples.
PMID: 37817908

Abstract:
Many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by genome-wide association studies exert their effects on disease risk as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) via allele-specific expression (ASE). While databases for probing eQTLs in tissues from normal individuals exist, one may wish to ascertain eQTLs or ASE in specific tissues or disease-states not characterized in these databases. Here, we present a protocol to assess ASE of two possible target genes (GPNMB and KLHL7) of a known genome-wide association study (GWAS) Parkinson's disease (PD) risk locus in postmortem human brain tissue from PD and neurologically normal individuals. This was done using a sequence of RNA isolation, cDNA library generation, enrichment for transcripts of interest using customizable cDNA capture probes, paired-end RNA sequencing, and subsequent analysis. This method provides increased sensitivity relative to traditional bulk RNAseq-based and a blueprint that can be extended to the study of other genes, tissues, and disease states. Key features • Analysis of <i>GPNMB</i> allele-specific expression (ASE) in brain lysates from cognitively normal controls (NC) and Parkinson's disease (PD) individuals. • Builds on the ASE protocol of Mayba et al. (2014) and extends application from cells to human tissue. • Increased sensitivity by enrichment for desired transcript via RNA CaptureSeq (Mercer et al., 2014). • Optimized for human brain lysates from cingulate gyrus, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum.
