PMID: 37541971

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common progressive age-related neurodegenerative disorder. Paramount evidence shed light on the role of PI3K/AKT signaling activation in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. PI3K/AKT signaling can be activated via cAMP-dependent pathways achieved by phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibition. Roflumilast is a well-known PDE4 inhibitor that is currently used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, roflumilast has been proposed as a favorable candidate for the treatment of neurological disorders. The current study aimed to unravel the neuroprotective role of roflumilast in the rotenone model of PD in rats. Ninety male rats were allocated into six groups as follows: control, rotenone (1.5 mg/kg/48 h, s.c.), L-dopa (22.5 mg/kg, p.o), and roflumilast (0.2, 0.4 or 0.8 mg/kg, p.o). All treatments were administrated for 21 days 1 h after rotenone injection. Rats treated with roflumilast showed an improvement in motor activity and coordination as well as preservation of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. Moreover, roflumilast increased cAMP level and activated the PI3K/AKT axis via stimulation of CREB/BDNF/TrkB and SIRT1/PTP1B/IGF1 signaling cascades. Roflumilast also caused an upsurge in mTOR and Nrf2, halted GSK-3β and NF-ĸB, and suppressed FoxO1 and caspase-3. Our study revealed that roflumilast exerted neuroprotective effects in rotenone-induced neurotoxicity in rats. These neuroprotective effects were mediated via the crosstalk between CREB/BDNF/TrkB and SIRT1/PTP1B/IGF1 signaling pathways which activates PI3K/AKT trajectory. Therefore, PDE4 inhibition is likely to offer a reliable persuasive avenue in curing PD via PI3K/AKT signaling activation.
