Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the formation of Lewy body, which mainly contains misfolded α-synuclein. Microglial activation plays a role in neurodegeneration. The pathologically oligomeric α-synuclein promotes inflammatory microglia, while physiologically monomeric α-synuclein induces anti-inflammatory microglia, the relationship between these two forms in activating microglia and the molecular mechanism is essentially unknown. In this study, using in vivo and in vitro models, we challenged primary or BV2 microglia with exogenous stimuli including α-synuclein. We examined microglial activation and the underlying mechanism by Western blot, RT-PCR, ELISA, IF, FCM, miRNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Oligomeric α-synuclein activatedmicroglia via theinvolvement of the PRAK/MK5 pathway. The specific PRAK inhibitor GLPG0259 could mitigate microglial activation insulted by oligomeric α-synuclein. Monomeric α-synuclein regulated theanti-inflammatory microglia by delivering microglia-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in vitro and in vivo. Furthersequencingand bioinformatic analysis of microglial EVs-associated miRNAs indicatedthatmost of these miRNAs targeted PRAK. These results suggest that PRAK serves as an intersection in microglial activation when challenged with conformationally different α-synuclein. EVs derived from microglia treated with monomeric α-synuclein promote anti-inflammatory microglia by delivering miRNAs that target PRAK into recipient microglia.
