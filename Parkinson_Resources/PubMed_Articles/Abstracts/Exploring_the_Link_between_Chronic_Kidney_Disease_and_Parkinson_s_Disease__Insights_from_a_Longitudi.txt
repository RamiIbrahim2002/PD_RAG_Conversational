PMID: 37513623

Abstract:
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are common illnesses found in the geriatric population. A potential link between CKD and PD emergence has been hypothesized; however, existing conclusions are disputed. In this longitudinal research, we analyzed data acquired from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort. The dataset comprised the health information of 16,559 individuals clinically diagnosed with CKD and 66,236 control subjects of comparable ages, all aged ≥40 years. These subjects participated in health examinations from 2002 to 2019. To assess the correlation between CKD and PD, we employed overlap-weighted Cox proportional hazard regression models. The unadjusted, crude hazard ratio for PD was greater in the CKD group than in the control group (crude hazard ration (HR) 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.39; <i>p</i> = 0.011). However, the Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, incorporating propensity score overlap weighting, revealed no significant discrepancy after considering confounding variables such as demographic factors, socio-economic status, lifestyle, and concurrent health conditions (adjusted HR (aHR), 1.09; 95% CI = 0.97-1.22; <i>p</i> = 0.147). Subgroup analyses showed a higher probability of PD development among certain CKD individuals, including those who resided in rural areas (aHR, 1.19; 95% CI = 1.03-1.37; <i>p</i> = 0.022), maintained a normal weight (aHR, 1.29; 95% CI = 1.08-1.56; <i>p</i> = 0.006), or had fasting blood glucose levels ≥100 mg/dL (aHR, 1.18; 95% CI = 1.00-1.39; <i>p</i> = 0.046). Therefore, these clinical or environmental factors may influence the incidence of PD in CKD patients. In conclusion, our results suggest that the general CKD population may not exhibit a greater propensity for PD than their non-CKD counterparts. However, this might be contingent upon specific lifestyle and comorbid conditions. Thus, certain lifestyle alterations could be crucial in mitigating the potential manifestation of PD in patients diagnosed with CKD.
