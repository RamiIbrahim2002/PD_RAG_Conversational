PMID: 37970321

Abstract:
Given the rise in the elderly population and predicted increase in age-related diseases like Parkinson's disease, as well as the treatment gaps in Low-and-Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), there is an urgent need to develop a culturally and socioeconomically viable Parkinson's model of care that would be multidisciplinary, replicable, affordable, and accessible to those who need it the most. We present here an outline of a rehabilitation model of care, which incorporates a standardized group therapy format, community-based Parkinson's Support Centers, collaboration with local stakeholders to ensure sustainability, and active engagement of People with Parkinson's (PwPs) and caregivers (CGs) in rehabilitation programs. This model of care incorporates a unique 16-session multi-disciplinary community rehabilitation module for PwPs and CGs which is evidence-based, easily deliverable by non-medical facilitators, relevant to PwPs and CGs, adaptable to different groups, practical and beneficial, and effective in a group - format. This rehabilitation model of care, encompassing the multidisciplinary rehabilitation module, holds promise for implementation in LMICs due to its dynamic nature, cost-effectiveness, community-based approach and easy adaptability to telehealth platforms. We share our experience of developing the model and outline implications for practice and insights about community rehabilitation work in LMICs.
