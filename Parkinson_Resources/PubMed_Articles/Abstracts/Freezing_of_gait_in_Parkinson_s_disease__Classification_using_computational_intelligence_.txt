Title: Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease: Classification using computational intelligence.
PMID: 37634658

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease represented by the progressive loss of dopamine producing neurons, with motor and non-motor symptoms that may be hard to distinguish from other disorders. Affecting millions of people across the world, its symptoms include bradykinesia, tremors, depression, rigidity, postural instability, cognitive decline, and falls. Furthermore, changes in gait can be used as a primary diagnosis factor. A dataset is described that records data on healthy individuals and on PD patients, including those who experience freezing of gait, in both the ON and OFF-medication states. The dataset is comprised of data for four separate tasks: voluntary stop, timed up and go, simple motor task, and dual motor and cognitive task. Seven different classifiers are applied to two problems relating to this data. The first problem is to distinguish PD patients from healthy individuals, both overall and per task. The second problem is to determine the effectiveness of medication. A thorough analysis on the classifiers and their results is performed. Overall, multilayer perceptron and decision tree provide the most consistent results.
