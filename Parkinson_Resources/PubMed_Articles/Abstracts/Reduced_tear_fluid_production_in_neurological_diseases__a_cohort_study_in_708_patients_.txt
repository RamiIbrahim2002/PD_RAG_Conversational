Title: Reduced tear fluid production in neurological diseases: a cohort study in 708 patients.
PMID: 38063868

Abstract:
Tear fluid (TF) production is an important component of normal ocular function. It is regulated by parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation. Because parasympathetic nerve fibers originate in the brainstem, pathology in this brain region may affect TF production. For example, a reduction in TF production has been described in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
