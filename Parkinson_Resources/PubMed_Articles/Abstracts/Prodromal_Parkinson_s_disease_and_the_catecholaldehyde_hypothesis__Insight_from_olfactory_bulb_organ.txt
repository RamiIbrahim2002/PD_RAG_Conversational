Title: Prodromal Parkinson's disease and the catecholaldehyde hypothesis: Insight from olfactory bulb organotypic cultures.
PMID: 37997495

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder with an increasing incidence, unknown etiology, and is currently incurable. Advances in understanding the pathological mechanisms at a molecular level have been slow, with little attention focused on the early prodromal phase of the disease. Consequently, the development of early-acting disease-modifying therapies has been hindered. The olfactory bulb (OB), the brain region responsible for initial processing of olfactory information, is particularly affected early in PD at both functional and molecular levels but there is little information on how the cells in this region are affected by disease. Organotypic and primary OB cultures were developed and characterized. These platforms were then used to assess the effects of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetylaldehyde (DOPAL), a metabolite of dopamine present in increased levels in post-mortem PD tissue and which is thought to contribute to PD pathogenesis. Our findings showed that DOPAL exposure can recapitulate many aspects of PD pathology. Oxidative stress, depolarization of mitochondrial membranes, and neurodegeneration were all induced by DOPAL addition, as were measured transcriptomic changes consistent with those reported in PD clinical studies. These olfactory models of prodromal disease lend credence to the catecholaldehyde hypothesis of PD and provide insight into the mechanisms by which the OB may be involved in disease progression.
