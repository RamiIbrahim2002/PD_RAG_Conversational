PMID: 37501541

Abstract:
Ophthalmological symptoms are common in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and can be evaluated by the Visual Impairment in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (VIPD-Q). This study aimed to assess the prevalence of ophthalmological symptoms in PD depending on the type of treatment used i.e. pharmacological or subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS).
