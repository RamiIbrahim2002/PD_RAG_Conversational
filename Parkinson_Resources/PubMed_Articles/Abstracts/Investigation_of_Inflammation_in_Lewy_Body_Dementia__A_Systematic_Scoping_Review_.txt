Title: Investigation of Inflammation in Lewy Body Dementia: A Systematic Scoping Review.
PMID: 37569491

Abstract:
Inflammatory mechanisms are increasingly recognized as important contributors to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Lewy body dementia (LBD). Our objectives were to, firstly, review inflammation investigation methods in LBD (dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia) and, secondly, identify alterations in inflammatory signals in LBD compared to people without neurodegenerative disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. A systematic scoping review was performed by searching major electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and PSYCHInfo) to identify relevant human studies. Of the 2509 results screened, 80 studies were included. Thirty-six studies analyzed postmortem brain tissue, and 44 investigated living subjects with cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and/or brain imaging assessments. Largely cross-sectional data were available, although two longitudinal clinical studies investigated prodromal Lewy body disease. Investigations were focused on inflammatory immune cell activity (microglia, astrocytes, and lymphocytes) and inflammatory molecules (cytokines, etc.). Results of the included studies identified innate and adaptive immune system contributions to inflammation associated with Lewy body pathology and clinical disease features. Different signals in early and late-stage disease, with possible late immune senescence and dystrophic glial cell populations, were identified. The strength of these associations is limited by the varying methodologies, small study sizes, and cross-sectional nature of the data. Longitudinal studies investigating associations with clinical and other biomarker outcomes are needed to improve understanding of inflammatory activity over the course of LBD. This could identify markers of disease activity and support therapeutic development.
