Title: The Association between Parkinson's Disease and Congestive Heart Failure in Korea: A Nationwide Longitudinal Cohort Study.
PMID: 37763125

Abstract:
The purpose of this nationwide longitudinal follow-up study is to investigate the relationship between Parkinson's disease (PD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) patients in Korea. Patient data were collected using the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) Health Screening (HEALS) cohort. The International Classification of Diseases 10-CM code G-20 distinguished 6475 PD patients who were enrolled in the PD group. After removing 1039 patients who were not hospitalized or attended an outpatient clinic less than twice, the total number of participants was reduced to 5436 individuals. Then, 177 patients diagnosed before 1 January 2004 were removed for relevancy, leaving us with 5259 PD patients. After case-control matching was completed using 1:5 age- and gender-coordinated matching, 26,295 people were chosen as part of the control group. The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and the Kaplan-Meier technique were used to assess the risk of CHF in patients with Parkinson's disease. After controlling for age and gender, the hazard ratio of CHF in the PD group was 5.607 (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.496-6.993). After that, the hazard ratio of CHF in the PD group was modified against for comorbid medical disorders, resulting in a value of 5.696 (95% CI, 4.566-7.107). In subgroup analysis, CHF incidence rates were significantly increased in the PD group compared to the control group (males and females; aged â‰¥ 65 and <65; the non-diabetes and diabetes, hypertension and non-hypertension, and dyslipidemia and non-dyslipidemia subgroups). This nationwide longitudinal study shows a higher incidence rate of CHF in PD patients.
