PMID: 38007472

Abstract:
In our experience, working with a therapy animal strengthens endurance, maintains motivation, provides a sense of achievement, and boosts overall mental resilience. The aims of this work were to summarize the results of quantitative research on the possibilities of animal-assisted intervention (AAI) among people with neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases and to attempt to assess the effects of animal-assisted interventions in an objective manner and to find supporting evidence based on published literature.
