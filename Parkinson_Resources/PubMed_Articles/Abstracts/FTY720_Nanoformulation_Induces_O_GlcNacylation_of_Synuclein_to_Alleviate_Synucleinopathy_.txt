Title: FTY720 Nanoformulation Induces O-GlcNacylation of Synuclein to Alleviate Synucleinopathy.
PMID: 38109795

Abstract:
The post-translational modification and aggregation of alpha-synuclein are one of the major causes of Parkinson's disease (PD) regulation. In that, the phosphorylation and nitration of synuclein elevate the aggregation, while O-GlcNacylation prevents the aggregation of synuclein. The inhibition of synuclein aggregation directs the development of PD therapy. The endowed O-GlcNacylation of synuclein could be a promising strategy to inhibit synucleinopathy. Therefore, the neuroprotective chitosan-based FTY720 nanoformulation, PP2A (Protein phosphatase 2) activator has been employed to evaluate the PP2A role in the O-GlcNacylation of synuclein in an <i>in vivo</i> PD model. The neuroprotective effect of our nanoformulation is attributed to the upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the PD therapeutic target, with behavioral improvement in animals against rotenone-induced PD deficits. The neuroprotective molecular insights revealed the camouflaged role of PP2A by endowing the OGT activity that induces O-GlcNacylation of synuclein in the reduction of synucleinopathy.
