Title: The effects of auditory cues and weighted pens on handwriting in individuals with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37778882

Abstract:
Micrographia, or small handwriting, is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). Weighted pens have previously been recommended to improve handwriting, but there is limited research supporting their effectiveness. Additionally, previous research has demonstrated that music as an auditory cue can reduce variability in fine motor movements, but its effect on handwriting in people with PD remains unknown.
