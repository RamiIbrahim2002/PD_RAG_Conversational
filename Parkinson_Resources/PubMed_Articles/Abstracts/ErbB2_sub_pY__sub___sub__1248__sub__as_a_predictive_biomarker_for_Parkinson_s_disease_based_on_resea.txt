Title: ErbB2<sub>pY</sub> <sub>-1248</sub> as a predictive biomarker for Parkinson's disease based on research with RPPA technology and in vivo verification.
PMID: 37564024

Abstract:
This study aims to reveal a promising biomarker for Parkinson's disease (PD) based on research with reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technology for the first time and in vivo verification, which gains time for early intervention in PD, thus increasing the effectiveness of treatment and reducing disease morbidity.
