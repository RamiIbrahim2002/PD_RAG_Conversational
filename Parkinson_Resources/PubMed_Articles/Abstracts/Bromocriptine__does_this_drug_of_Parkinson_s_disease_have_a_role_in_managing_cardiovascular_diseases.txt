Title: Bromocriptine: does this drug of Parkinson's disease have a role in managing cardiovascular diseases?
PMID: 38333315

Abstract:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Bromocriptine is a partial antagonist for D1 dopamine receptors while also serving as a selective agonist on D2 dopamine receptors as a dopamine receptor agonist. Apart from prolactin inhibiting action, bromocriptine has some beneficial effects on the blood pressure, plasma norepinephrine levels and vascular resistance. Dopamine D2 receptor activation of bromocriptine is associated with the antihypertensive effect, which lowers blood pressure via inhibiting sympathetic nerve activity and Na/K ATPase activity. Plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1B and IL-18, chemokine CCL2/ MCP-1/, and the pro-inflammatory hormone prolactin, all of which are elevated and linked to accelerated cardiometabolic illness, were decreased because of bromocriptine therapy. The most common side effects of Bromocriptine use are dizziness, nausea, headache, vomiting and hypotension. Bromocriptine is mainly contraindicated in patients with syncope with hypotension, psychosis, and type I diabetes mellitus. The authors suggest that developing therapies directed to increase D2 receptor expression and function by drugs like Bromocriptine can provide practical and novelistic approaches to prevent and manage myocardial and renal injury in the cardiovascular disease patients.
