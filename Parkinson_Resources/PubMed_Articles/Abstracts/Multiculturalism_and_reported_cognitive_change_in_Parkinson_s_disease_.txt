Title: Multiculturalism and reported cognitive change in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37989559

Abstract:
Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and how much cognitive decline impacts one's ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living (iADLs) are necessary elements of neuropsychological assessment when diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Though limited, the literature suggests that culture and self-appraisal of cognitive abilities are related. However, it is unclear if differences exist in the subjective elements of neuropsychological assessments between patients born in Anglosphere countries (Canada, the USA, and the UK) versus immigrants born elsewhere (International Group).
