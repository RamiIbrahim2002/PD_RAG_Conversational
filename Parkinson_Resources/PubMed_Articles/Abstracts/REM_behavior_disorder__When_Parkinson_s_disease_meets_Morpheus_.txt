Title: REM behavior disorder: When Parkinson's disease meets Morpheus.
PMID: 37598085

Abstract:
Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by the absence of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep, resulting in excessive motor activity while dreaming. RBD can be classified as isolated which is the strongest clinical marker of prodromal synucleinopathy, or secondary, associated with other neurological diseases, mainly Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies. The diagnosis of RBD must be systematically documented by a video polysomnography in the case of isolated RBD. PD associated with RBD may represent a distinct phenotype compared to PD without RBD, indicating a more severe and widespread synucleinopathy. Clinically, it is associated with poorer motor and cognitive performance, more severe non-motor symptoms, and faster disease progression. Imaging studies have revealed broader brain damage and significant alterations in cerebral metabolism and neurotransmission in PD patients with RBD. The management of RBD involves safety precautions and pharmacotherapy. Safety measures aim to minimize the risk of injury during RBD episodes and include creating a safe sleeping environment and separating the patient from their bed partner if necessary. Pharmacotherapy options include clonazepam and melatonin. Clonazepam must be cautiously prescribed in older patients due to potential side effects.
