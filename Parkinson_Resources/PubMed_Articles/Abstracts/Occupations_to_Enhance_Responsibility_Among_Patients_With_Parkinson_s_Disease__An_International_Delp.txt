Title: Occupations to Enhance Responsibility Among Patients With Parkinson's Disease: An International Delphi Study.
PMID: 37585598

Abstract:
The ability to perform voluntary actions is disrupted in Parkinson's disease (PD). Voluntary activities play a critical role in generating sense of agency, which underpins the concept of responsibility for people's daily occupations and their outcomes. According to this concept, the dearth of research regarding the concept of responsibility in rehabilitation hampers practitioners in delivering evidence-based care.
