Title: Exercise Made Accessible: the Merits of Community-Based Programs for Persons with Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37792207

Abstract:
Many studies have identified positive effects of physiotherapy and exercise for persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). Most work has thus far focused on the therapeutic modality of exercise as used within physiotherapy programs. Stimulated by these positive findings, there is now a strong move to take exercise out of the clinical setting and to deliver the interventions in the community. Although the goals and effects of many such community-based exercise programs overlap with those of physiotherapy, it has also become more clear that both exercise modalities also differ in various ways. Here, we aim to comprehensively review the evidence for community-based exercise in PD.
