Title: Glutathione Depletion and Concomitant Elevation of Susceptibility in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: State-of-the-Art MR Spectroscopy and Neuropsychological Study.
PMID: 38050970

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by extrapyramidal motor disturbances and nonmotor cognitive impairments which impact activities of daily living. Although the etiology of PD is still obscure, autopsy reports suggest that oxidative stress (OS) is one of the important factors in the pathophysiology of PD. In the current study, we have investigated the impact of OS in PD by measuring the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) levels from the substantia nigra (SN), left hippocampus (LH) and neurotransmitter Î³-amino butyric acid (GABA) levels from SN region. Concomitant quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) from SN and LH was also acquired from thirty-eight PD patients and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HC). Glutathione levels in the SN region decreased significantly and susceptibility increased significantly in PD compared to HC. Nonsignificant depletion of GABA was observed in the SN region. GSH levels in the LH region were depleted significantly, but LH susceptibility did not alter in the PD cohort compared to HC. Neuropsychological and physical assessment demonstrated significant impairment of cognitive functioning in PD patients compared to HC. GSH depletion was negatively correlated to motor function performance. Multivariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis on the combined effect of GSH, GABA, and susceptibility in the SN region yielded an improved diagnostic accuracy of 86.1% compared to individual diagnostic accuracy based on GSH (65.8%), GABA (57.5%), and susceptibility (69.6%). This is the first comprehensive report in PD demonstrating significant GSH depletion as well as concomitant iron enhancement in the SN region.
