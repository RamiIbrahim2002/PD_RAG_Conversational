Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Despite decades of research, no effective disease modifying therapeutics have reached clinics for treatment/management of PD. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) which controls membrane trafficking and lysosomal function and its variant LRRK2-G2019S are involved in the development of both familial and sporadic PD. LRRK2, is therefore considered as a legitimate target for the development of therapeutics against PD. During the last decade, efforts have been made to develop effective, safe and selective LRRK2 inhibitors and also our understanding about LRRK2 has progressed. However, there is an urge to learn from the previously designed and reported LRRK2 inhibitors in order to effectively approach designing of new LRRK2 inhibitors. In this review, we have aimed to cover the pre-clinical studies undertaken to develop small molecule LRRK2 inhibitors by screening the patents and other available literature in the last decade. We have highlighted LRRK2 as targets in the progress of PD and subsequently covered detailed design, synthesis and development of diverse scaffolds as LRRK2 inhibitors. Moreover, LRRK2 inhibitors under clinical development has also been discussed. LRRK2 inhibitors seem to be potential targets for future therapeutic interventions in the treatment and management of PD and this review can act as a cynosure for guiding discovery, design, and development of selective and non-toxic LRRK2 inhibitors. Although, there might be challenges in developing effective LRRK2 inhibitors, the opportunity to successfully develop novel therapeutics targeting LRRK2 against PD has never been greater.
