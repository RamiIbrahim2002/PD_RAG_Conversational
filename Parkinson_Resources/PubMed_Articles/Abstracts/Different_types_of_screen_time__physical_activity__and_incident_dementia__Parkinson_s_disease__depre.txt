Title: Different types of screen time, physical activity, and incident dementia, Parkinson's disease, depression and multimorbidity status.
PMID: 37924067

Abstract:
Several previous studies have shown that excessive screen time is associated with an increased prevalence of dementia, Parkinson's disease (PD), and depression. However, the results have been inconsistent. This study aimed to prospectively investigate the association between different types of screen time and brain structure, as well as the incidence of dementia, Parkinson's disease, depression, and their multimorbidity status.
