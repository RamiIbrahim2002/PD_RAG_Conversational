Title: <i>Escherichia coli</i> triggers α-synuclein pathology in the <i>LRRK2</i> transgenic mouse model of PD.
PMID: 38010914

Abstract:
Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) pathology is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (<i>LRRK2</i>) gene is a major-effect risk gene for sporadic PD (sPD). However, what environmental factors may trigger the formation of α-syn pathology in carriers of <i>LRRK2</i> risk variants are still unknown. Here, we report that a markedly increased abundance of <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>) in the intestinal microbiota was detected in <i>LRRK2</i> risk variant(R1628P or G2385R) carriers with sPD compared with carriers without sPD. Animal experiments showed that <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> administration triggered pathological α-syn accumulation in the colon and spread to the brain via the gut-brain axis in <i>Lrrk2</i> R1628P mice, due to the co-occurrence of <i>Lrrk2</i> variant-induced inhibition of α-syn autophagic degradation and increased phosphorylation of α-syn caused by curli in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>-derived extracellular vesicles. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) effectively ameliorated motor deficits and α-syn pathology in <i>Lrrk2</i> R1628P mice. Our findings elaborate on the mechanism that <i>E. coli</i> triggers α-syn pathology in <i>Lrrk2</i> R1628P mice, and highlight a novel gene-environment interaction pattern in <i>LRRK2</i> risk variants. Even more importantly, the findings reveal the interplay between the specific risk gene and the matched environmental factors triggers the initiation of α-syn pathology in sPD.
