Abstract:
<i>Calendula officinalis</i> flowers, associated with diverse biological effects, could be utilized as functional food ingredients to play a crucial role in human health. In this study, we examined the anti-PD activity of <i>C. officinalis</i> flower extracts and investigated their bioactive compounds and molecular mechanisms based on LC-MS/MS assay, bioinformatic exploration and in vitro treatment of SH-SY5Y cells. <i>C. officinalis</i> extracts exhibited significant positive effects on the length and fluorescence density of the dopaminergic neuron region in zebrafish larvae. At 10 μg/mL, the extract restored the length to 96.54% and fluorescence density to 87.77% of the control values, which was equivalent to the effect of a positive drug, indicating the extract's powerful potential to alleviate PD symptoms. Five active compounds, including chlorogenic acid, 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid (DA), rutin, isorhamnetin 3-O-glucoside (IG) and calenduloside E (CE) were identified in extracts by LC-QTOF-MS/MS. Hsp90α, PI3K and ERK were revealed as core targets of DA, IG and CE in relation to anti-PD activity. The compounds docked deeply within the pocket region of Hsp90α protein, and their binding energies (∆<i>G</i> <sub>b</sub>) were -6.93 kcal/mol (DA), -6.51 kcal/mol (IG) and -3.03 kcal/mol (CE), respectively. Subsequently, they concurrently activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inhibited the ERK signaling pathway, thereby preventing neuronal death and alleviating neuronal degeneration. These compounds from <i>C. officinalis</i> could be potent nutraceutical agents with protective properties that may shield dopaminergic neurons against the damage caused by PD. Our findings provide a basis for utilizing the <i>C. officinalis</i> flowers in functional foods.
