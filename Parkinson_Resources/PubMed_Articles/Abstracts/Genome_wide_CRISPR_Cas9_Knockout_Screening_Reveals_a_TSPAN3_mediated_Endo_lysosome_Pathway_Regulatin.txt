Title: Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout Screening Reveals a TSPAN3-mediated Endo-lysosome Pathway Regulating the Degradation of α-Synuclein Oligomers.
PMID: 37477766

Abstract:
Misfolding and aggregation of α-Synuclein (α-Syn), which are hallmark pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy Bodies, continue to be significant areas of research. Among the diverse forms of α-Syn - monomer, oligomer, and fibril, the oligomer is considered the most toxic. However, the mechanisms governing α-Syn oligomerization are not yet fully understood. In this study, we utilized genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screening in human HEK293 cells to identify negative regulators of α-Syn oligomerization. We found that tetraspanin 3 (TSPAN3), a presumptive four-pass transmembrane protein, but not its homolog TSPAN7, significantly modulates α-Syn oligomer levels. TSPAN3 was observed to interact with α-Syn oligomers, regulate the amount of α-Syn oligomers on the cell membrane, and promote their degradation via the clathrin-AP2 mediated endo-lysosome pathway. Our findings highlight TSPAN3 as a potential regulator of α-Syn oligomers, presenting a promising target for future PD prevention and treatment strategies.
