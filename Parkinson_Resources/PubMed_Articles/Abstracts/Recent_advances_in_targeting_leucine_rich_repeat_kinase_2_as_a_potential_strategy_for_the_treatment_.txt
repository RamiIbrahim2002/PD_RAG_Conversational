Title: Recent advances in targeting leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 as a potential strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37837728

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Several single gene mutations involved in PD have been identified such as leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), the most common cause of sporadic and familial PD. Its mutations have attracted much attention to therapeutically targeting this kinase. To date, many compounds including small chemical molecules with diverse scaffolds and RNA agents have been developed with significant amelioration in preclinical PD models. Currently, five candidates, DNL201, DNL151, WXWH0226, NEU-723 and BIIB094, have advanced to clinical trials for PD treatment. In this review, we describe the structure, pathogenic mutations and the mechanism of LRRK2, and summarize the development of LRRK2 inhibitors in preclinical and clinical studies, trying to provide an insight into targeting LRRK2 for PD intervention in future.
