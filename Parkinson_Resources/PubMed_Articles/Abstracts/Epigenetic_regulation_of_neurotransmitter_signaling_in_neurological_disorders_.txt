Title: Epigenetic regulation of neurotransmitter signaling in neurological disorders.
PMID: 37479091

Abstract:
Neurotransmission signaling is a highly conserved system attributed to various regulatory events. The excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems have been extensively studied, and their role in neuronal cell proliferation, synaptogenesis and dendrite formation in the adult brain is well established. Recent research has shown that epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in mediating the expression of key genes associated with neurotransmitter pathways, including neurotransmitter receptor and transporter genes. The dysregulation of these genes has been linked to a range of neurological disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. This article focuses on epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that control the expression of genes associated with four major chemical carriers in the brain: dopamine (DA), Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and serotonin. Additionally, we explore how aberrant epigenetic regulation of these genes can contribute to the pathogenesis of relevant neurological disorders. By targeting the epigenetic mechanisms that control neurotransmitter gene expression, there is a promising opportunity to advance the development of more effective treatments for neurological disorders with the potential to significantly improve the quality of life of individuals impacted by these conditions.
