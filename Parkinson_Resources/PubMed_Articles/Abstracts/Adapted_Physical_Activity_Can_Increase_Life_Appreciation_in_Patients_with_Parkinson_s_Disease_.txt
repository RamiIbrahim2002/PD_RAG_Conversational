PMID: 37455462

Abstract:
<b>Objectives:</b>This study aimed to measure the effect of a treatment of adapted physical activity (APA) on motor symptoms and on positive psychological resources in a group of patients with PD. <b>Methods:</b> 37 patients with PD (M<i><sub>age</sub></i>= 71.5; 70.3% male) completed measures of disability level, motor performance, distress, well-being, and quality of life before and after participating in a program of APA (duration: 7 months). Analysis of variance - repeated measures was performed to evaluate the effect of APA on disability, distress, and well-being. <b>Results:</b> After intervention, patients reported significant improvements in their motor autonomy, disability level, psychological distress, and in life appreciation. <b>Discussion:</b> A brief physical activity program was beneficial not only to patients' motor functioning, but also to their mental health, by reducing distress and promoting life appreciation.
