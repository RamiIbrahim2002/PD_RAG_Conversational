Title: Photo-Induced Cross-Linking of Unmodified α-Synuclein Oligomers.
PMID: 37621159

Abstract:
Photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) has been used in the past to study size distributions of protein assemblies. PICUP may, for example, overcome the significant experimental challenges related to the transient nature, heterogeneity, and low concentration of amyloid protein oligomers relative to monomeric and fibrillar species. In the current study, a reaction chamber was designed, produced, and used for PICUP reaction optimization in terms of reaction conditions and lighting time from ms to s. These efforts make the method more reproducible and accessible and enable the use of shorter reaction times compared to previous studies. We applied the optimized method to an α-synuclein aggregation time course to monitor the relative concentration and size distribution of oligomers over time. The data are compared to the time evolution of the fibril mass concentration, as monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence. At all time points, the smaller the oligomer, the higher its concentration observed after PICUP. Moreover, the total oligomer concentration is highest at short aggregation times, and the decline over time follows the disappearance of monomers. We can therefore conclude that these oligomers form from monomers.
