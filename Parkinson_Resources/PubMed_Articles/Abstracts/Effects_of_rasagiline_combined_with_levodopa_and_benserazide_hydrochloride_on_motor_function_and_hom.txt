PMID: 37803329

Abstract:
During the course of their illness, people with Parkinson's disease may see changes in their insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and serum homocysteine (Hcy) indices. In this study, patients with intermediate to severe Parkinson's disease were examined for how Resagiline and levodopa and benserazide hydrochloride affected their motor performance, serum levels of homocysteine (Hcy), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1).
