Title: Implications of In Vitro Multi-Serine Phosphorylation of Alpha-Synuclein in Aggregation and Cytotoxicity.
PMID: 37562012

Abstract:
Post-translational modifications guide the functional diversity and identity of proteins. Phosphorylation is one such post-translational modification that has been reported in pathological proteins related to various neurodegenerative disorders such as α-synuclein (α-syn) phosphorylation in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. In α-syn, the phosphorylation has mostly been observed at S129; however, the occurrence of other serine modifications at S9, S42, and S87 is partially explored. In pathogenic conditions, where α-syn is phosphorylated by complex kinase pathways, multi-site modifications may happen and alter the mechanism of α-syn aggregation. Here, using Polo-like kinase 2 and G-protein coupled receptor kinase 4, the in vitro phosphorylation of α-syn was performed, which revealed multi-serine phosphorylation. Mass spectrometry with customized proteolytic digestion showed prominent phosphorylation at S129 and modifications at S87 and S42 with PLK2 and S87 with GRK4. The phosphorylation at the identified serine residues was further validated with NMR and western blotting. Multi-serine phosphorylation aggravates the aggregation potential of monomeric α-syn, seeding capacity, and cytotoxicity in the SH-SY5Y cell line. This study proposes evidence for in vitro multi-site phosphorylation and its significance in α-syn aggregation, toxicity, and related pathogenesis.
