Abstract:
Artemisinin is an antimalarial drug that has been used for almost half a century. However, the anti-Parkinson's disease (PD) effects of artemisinin with respect to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced oxidative stress have not yet been investigated while focusing on NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling. Thus, we sought to assess the behavioral and oxidative mechanistic effects of artemisinin on MPTP-induced toxicity via the Nrf2 signaling pathway. We explored this through immunohistochemical assays, ELISA, in differentiated PC12 cells treated with siRNA, and with a PD mouse model. Artemisinin increased Nrf2 DNA-binding activity and HO-1 and NQO1 expression. Artemisinin treatment protected cells against MPP+Â -induced neuronal death signaling, including NADH dehydrogenase activity, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, it protected cells against MPTP-induced behavioral impairments and significantly reduced dopaminergic neuronal loss. Additionally, Nrf2 pre-inhibition using ML385 neutralized the inhibitory effects of artemisinin on dopaminergic neuronal damage and behavioral impairments induced by MPTP. Our results suggest that artemisinin inhibits MPTP-induced behavioral and neurotoxic effects in mice. This provides a foundation for further research to evaluate artemisinin as a potential therapeutic agent for PD.
