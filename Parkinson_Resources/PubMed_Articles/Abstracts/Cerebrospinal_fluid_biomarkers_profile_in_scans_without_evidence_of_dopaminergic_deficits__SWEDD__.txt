Title: Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers profile in scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficits (SWEDD).
PMID: 37953806

Abstract:
A small proportion of patients with clinical parkinsonism have normal transporter-single photon emission computed tomography (DaTSPECT) which is commonly defined as scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficits (SWEDD). A better understanding of SWEDD can improve the current therapeutic options and appropriate disease monitoring.
