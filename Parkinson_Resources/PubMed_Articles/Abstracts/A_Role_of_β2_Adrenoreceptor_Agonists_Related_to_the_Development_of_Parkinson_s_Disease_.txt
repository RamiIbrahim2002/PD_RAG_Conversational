Title: A Role of β2-Adrenoreceptor Agonists Related to the Development of Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37635503

Abstract:
Several studies have suggested the potential protective role of β2-adrenoreceptor agonist (β2AR-agonist) on the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, those could not reflect a different epidemiologic background in eastern countries. We explored β2AR-agonist's effect on PD development by controlling for smoking.
