Title: Macro and micro-sleep dysfunctions as translational biomarkers for Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38341229

Abstract:
Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and often appear from the early-phase disease or prodromal stages. In this chapter, we will discuss the current evidence addressing the links between sleep dysfunctions in PD, focusing most closely on those data from animal and mathematical/computational models, as well as in human-based studies that explore the electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms by which PD and sleep may be intertwined, whether as predictors or consequences of the disease. It is possible to clearly state that leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2) is significantly related to alterations in sleep architecture, particularly affecting rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep, thus impacting sleep quality. Also, decreases in gamma power, observed after dopaminergic lesions, correlates negatively with the degree of injury, which brings other levels of understanding the impacts of the disease. Besides, abnormal synchronized oscillations among basal ganglia nuclei can be detrimental for information processing considering both motor and sleep-related processes. Altogether, despite clear advances in the field, it is still difficult to definitely establish a comprehensive understanding of causality among all the sleep dysfunctions with the disease itself. Although, certainly, the search for biomarkers is helping in shortening this road towards a better and faster diagnosis, as well as looking for more efficient treatments.
