PMID: 37993683

Abstract:
There has been emerging attention to investigate the possible role of some dietary factors in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, evidence about the relationship between dietary components and the risk of PD is limited. The aim of this study was to determine the association between major dietary patterns and the risk of PD.
