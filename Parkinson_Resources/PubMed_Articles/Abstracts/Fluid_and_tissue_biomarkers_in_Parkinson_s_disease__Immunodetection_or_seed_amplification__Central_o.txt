Title: Fluid and tissue biomarkers in Parkinson's disease: Immunodetection or seed amplification? Central or peripheral?
PMID: 38168618

Abstract:
Over the last two decades there have been meaningful developments on biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases, extensively (but not solely) focusing on their proteinopathic nature. Accordingly, in Alzheimer's disease determination of levels of total and phosphorylated tau (τ and p-τ, usually p-τ181) along with amyloid-beta1-42 (Aβ1-42) by immunodetection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and currently even in peripheral blood, have been widely accepted and introduced to routine diagnosis. In the case of Parkinson's disease, α-synuclein as a potential biomarker (both for diagnosis and progression tracking) has proved more elusive under the immunodetection approach. In recent years, the emergence of the so-called seed amplification assays is proving to be a game-changer, with mounting evidence under different technical approaches and using a variety of biofluids or tissues, yielding promising diagnostic accuracies. Currently the least invasive but at once more reliable source of biosamples and techniques are being sought. Here we overview these advances.
