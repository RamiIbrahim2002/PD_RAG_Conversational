PMID: 37751075

Abstract:
Movement disorders (Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, primary dystonia) are a debilitating group of conditions that are progressive in nature. The mainstay of treatment is best medical therapy; however, a number of surgical therapies are available, including deep brain stimulation. Economic evaluations are an important aspect of evidence to inform decision makers regarding funding allocated to these therapies.
