PMID: 37702113

Abstract:
The aggregation and spread of alpha-synuclein (αSyn) is associated with several pathogenic pathways that lead to neurodegeneration and, ultimately, to synucleinopathies development. Hence, the establishment of a safe and effective disease-modifying therapy that limits or prevents the spread of toxic αSyn aggregation could lead to positive clinical outcomes. A rational vaccine design can be focused on the selection of specific epitopes able to induce the immune response desired, for example, antibodies able to mediate the clearance of αSyn aggregates without the induction of inflammatory responses. To develop a rapid system for the evaluation of a vaccine candidate against synucleinopathies, rLTB-Syn (an antigen based on three B cell epitopes from αSyn and the B subunit of the heat-labile Escherichia coli enterotoxin [LTB] as adjuvant/carrier) was produced using recombinant E. coli (Rosetta DE3) as the expression host. The bacterial version of rLTB-Syn was produced as soluble protein at yields up to 1.72 mg/g biomass. A method for the purification of rLTB-Syn (~18 kDa) was developed based on ion exchange chromatography, reaching purity >93% with a final concentration of 82.6 μg/mL. Furthermore, the purified soluble rLTB-Syn retained GM1 binding activity, suggesting proper folding and pentameric structure. The results from this study establish a fast and effective method to obtain rLTB-Syn, making it useful in the design of novel vaccine formulations targeting synucleinopathies.
