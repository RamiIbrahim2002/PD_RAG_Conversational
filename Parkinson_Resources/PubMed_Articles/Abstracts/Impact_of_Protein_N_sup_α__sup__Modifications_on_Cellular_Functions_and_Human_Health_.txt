Title: Impact of Protein N<sup>α</sup>-Modifications on Cellular Functions and Human Health.
PMID: 37511988

Abstract:
Most human proteins are modified by enzymes that act on the α-amino group of a newly synthesized polypeptide. Methionine aminopeptidases can remove the initiator methionine and expose the second amino acid for further modification by enzymes responsible for myristoylation, acetylation, methylation, or other chemical reactions. Specific acetyltransferases can also modify the initiator methionine and sometimes the acetylated methionine can be removed, followed by further modifications. These modifications at the protein N-termini play critical roles in cellular protein localization, protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and protein stability. Consequently, the dysregulation of these modifications could significantly change the development and progression status of certain human diseases. The focus of this review is to highlight recent progress in our understanding of the roles of these modifications in regulating protein functions and how these enzymes have been used as potential novel therapeutic targets for various human diseases.
