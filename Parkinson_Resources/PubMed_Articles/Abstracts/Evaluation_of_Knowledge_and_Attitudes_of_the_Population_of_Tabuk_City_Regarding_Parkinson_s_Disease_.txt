PMID: 37927685

Abstract:
The lack of awareness and information about PD may be a barrier to early diagnosis and the delivery of the best care to patients with the condition, given its rising prevalence. In order to determine the variables that are connected to these parameters, this study sought to ascertain the general public's knowledge and awareness of PD in Tabuk City.
