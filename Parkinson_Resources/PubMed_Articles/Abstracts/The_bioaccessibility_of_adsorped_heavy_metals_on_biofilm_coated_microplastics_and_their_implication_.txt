PMID: 37782357

Abstract:
Microplastic (MP) tiny fragments (< 5 mm) of conventional and specialized industrial polymers are persistent and ubiquitous in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem. Breathing, ingestion, consumption of food stuffs, potable water, and skin are possible routes of MP exposure that pose potential human health risk. Various microorganisms including bacteria, cyanobacteria, and microalgae rapidly colonized on MP surfaces which initiate biofilm formation. It gradually changed the MP surface chemistry and polymer properties that attract environmental metals. Physicochemical and environmental parameters like polymer type, dissolved organic matter (DOM), pH, salinity, ion concentrations, and microbial community compositions regulate metal adsorption on MP biofilm surface. A set of highly conserved proteins tightly regulates metal uptake, subcellular distribution, storage, and transport to maintain cellular homeostasis. Exposure of metal-MP biofilm can disrupt that cellular homeostasis to induce toxicities. Imbalances in metal concentrations therefore led to neuronal network dysfunction, ROS, mitochondrial damage in diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Prion disorder. This review focuses on the biofilm development on MP surfaces, factors controlling the growth of MP biofilm which triggered metal accumulation to induce neurotoxicological consequences in human body and stategies to reestablish the homeostasis. Thus, the present study gives a new approach on the health risks of heavy metals associated with MP biofilm in which biofilms trigger metal accumulation and MPs serve as a vector for those accumulated metals causing metal dysbiosis in human body.
