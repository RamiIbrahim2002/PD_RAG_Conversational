Title: Triaging between post-translational modification of cell cycle regulators and their therapeutics in neurodegenerative diseases.
PMID: 38135008

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, present challenges in healthcare because of their complicated etiologies and absence of healing remedies. Lately, the emerging role of post-translational modifications (PTMs), in the context of cell cycle regulators, has garnered big interest as a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention. The review explores the problematic panorama of PTMs on cell cycle regulators and their implications in neurodegenerative diseases. We delve into the dynamic phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, Glycation, and Neddylation that modulate the key cell cycle regulators, consisting of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and their inhibitors. The dysregulation of these PTMs is related to aberrant cell cycle in neurons, which is one of the factors involved in neurodegenerative pathologies. Moreover, the effect of exogenous activation of CDKs and CDK inhibitors through PTMs on the signaling cascade was studied in postmitotic conditions of NDDs. Furthermore, the therapeutic implications of CDK inhibitors and associated alteration in PTMs were discussed. Lastly, we explored the putative mechanism of PTMs to restore normal neuronal function that might reverse NDDs.
