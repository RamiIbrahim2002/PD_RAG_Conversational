Title: The Golgi Apparatus: A Voyage through Time, Structure, Function and Implication in Neurodegenerative Disorders.
PMID: 37566051

Abstract:
This comprehensive review article dives deep into the Golgi apparatus, an essential organelle in cellular biology. Beginning with its discovery during the 19th century until today's recognition as an important contributor to cell function. We explore its unique organization and structure as well as its roles in protein processing, sorting, and lipid biogenesis, which play key roles in maintaining homeostasis in cellular biology. This article further explores Golgi biogenesis, exploring its intricate processes and dynamics that contribute to its formation and function. One key focus is its role in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, where changes to the structure or function of the Golgi apparatus may lead to their onset or progression, emphasizing its key importance in neuronal health. At the same time, we examine the intriguing relationship between Golgi stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, providing insights into their interplay as two major cellular stress response pathways. Such interdependence provides a greater understanding of cellular reactions to protein misfolding and accumulation, hallmark features of many neurodegenerative diseases. In summary, this review offers an exhaustive examination of the Golgi apparatus, from its historical background to its role in health and disease. Additionally, this examination emphasizes the necessity of further research in this field in order to develop targeted therapeutic approaches for Golgi dysfunction-associated conditions. Furthermore, its exploration is an example of scientific progress while simultaneously offering hope for developing innovative treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.
