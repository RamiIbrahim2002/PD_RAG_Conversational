PMID: 37614147

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the formation of Lewy bodies (LBs) in the brain. These LBs are primarily composed of α-Synuclein (α-Syn), which has aggregated. A recent report proposes that CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins β (C/EBPβ) may act as an age-dependent transcription factor for α-Syn, thereby initiating PD pathologies by regulating its transcription. Potential therapeutic approaches to address PD could involve targeting the regulation of α-Syn by C/EBPβ. This study has revealed that Nrf2, also known as nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NFE2L2), suppresses the transcription of C/EBPβ in SH-SY5Y cells when treated with MPP<sup>+</sup> . To activate Nrf2, sulforaphane, an Nrf2 activator, was administered. Additionally, C/EBPβ was silenced using C/EBPβ-DNA/RNA heteroduplex oligonucleotide (HDO). Both approaches successfully reduced abnormal α-Syn expression in primary neurons treated with MPP<sup>+</sup> . Furthermore, sustained activation of Nrf2 via its activator or inhibition of C/EBPβ using C/EBPβ-HDO resulted in a reduction of aberrant α-Syn expression, thus leading to an improvement in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in mouse models induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and those treated with preformed fibrils (PFFs). The data presented in this study illustrate that the activation of Nrf2 may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for PD by inhibiting the abnormal C/EBPβ/α-Syn signaling pathway.
