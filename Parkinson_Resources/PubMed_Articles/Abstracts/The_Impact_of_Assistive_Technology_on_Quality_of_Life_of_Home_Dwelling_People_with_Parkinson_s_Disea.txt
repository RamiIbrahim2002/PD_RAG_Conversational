Title: The Impact of Assistive Technology on Quality of Life of Home-Dwelling People with Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37417573

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurological disease worldwide with more than 8.5 million people diagnosed. Assistive technologies for people with PD support the user to maximize independence. The purpose of this integrative literature review was to critique and synthesize the literature on the impact of assistive technologies on quality of life of home-dwelling individuals with PD. A literature search for studies on assistive technologies for people with PD with a primary outcome measure of quality of life was conducted. Of 156 articles screened for eligibility, 6 met selection criteria, including 4 quantitative studies, 1 qualitative study, and 1 mixed-method. Levels of evidence were scored as a percentage of quality criteria met, from 60% to 100% using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Using home monitoring devices was associated with significant improvements in walking, especially during freezing of gait. Evidence supports the use of assistive technologies including voice-activated technology, home automation, and home monitoring devices. Further research is needed to determine the effect of assistive technology on quality of life.
