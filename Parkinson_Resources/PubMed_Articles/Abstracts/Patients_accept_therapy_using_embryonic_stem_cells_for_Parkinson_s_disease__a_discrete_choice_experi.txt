Title: Patients accept therapy using embryonic stem cells for Parkinson's disease: a discrete choice experiment.
PMID: 37828462

Abstract:
New disease-modifying ways to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) may soon become a reality with intracerebral transplantation of cell products produced from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The aim of this study was to assess what factors influence preferences of patients with PD regarding stem-cell based therapies to treat PD in the future.
