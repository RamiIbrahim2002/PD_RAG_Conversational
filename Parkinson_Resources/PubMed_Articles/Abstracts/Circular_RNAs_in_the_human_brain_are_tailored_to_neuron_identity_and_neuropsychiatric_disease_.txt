Title: Circular RNAs in the human brain are tailored to neuron identity and neuropsychiatric disease.
PMID: 37723137

Abstract:
Little is known about circular RNAs (circRNAs) in specific brain cells and human neuropsychiatric disease. Here, we systematically identify over 11,039 circRNAs expressed in vulnerable dopamine and pyramidal neurons laser-captured from 190 human brains and non-neuronal cells using ultra-deep, total RNA sequencing. 1526 and 3308 circRNAs are custom-tailored to the cell identity of dopamine and pyramidal neurons and enriched in synapse pathways. 29% of Parkinson's and 12% of Alzheimer's disease-associated genes produced validated circRNAs. circDNAJC6, which is transcribed from a juvenile-onset Parkinson's gene, is already dysregulated during prodromal, onset stages of common Parkinson's disease neuropathology. Globally, addiction-associated genes preferentially produce circRNAs in dopamine neurons, autism-associated genes in pyramidal neurons, and cancers in non-neuronal cells. This study shows that circular RNAs in the human brain are tailored to neuron identity and implicate circRNA-regulated synaptic specialization in neuropsychiatric diseases.
