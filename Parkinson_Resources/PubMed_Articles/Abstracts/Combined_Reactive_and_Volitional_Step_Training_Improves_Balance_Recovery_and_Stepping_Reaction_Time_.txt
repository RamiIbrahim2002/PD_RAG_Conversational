Title: Combined Reactive and Volitional Step Training Improves Balance Recovery and Stepping Reaction Time in People With Parkinson's Disease: A Randomised Controlled Trial.
PMID: 37864439

Abstract:
Falls are frequent and devastating events for people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we investigated whether laboratory-based reactive step training combined with home-based volitional step training was effective in improving balance recovery and stepping ability in people with PD.
