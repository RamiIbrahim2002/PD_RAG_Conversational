Title: Adaptation strategies and neurophysiological response in early-stage Parkinson's disease: BioVRSea approach.
PMID: 37529404

Abstract:
There is accumulating evidence that many pathological conditions affecting human balance are consequence of postural control (PC) failure or overstimulation such as in motion sickness. Our research shows the potential of using the response to a complex postural control task to assess patients with early-stage Parkinson's Disease (PD).
