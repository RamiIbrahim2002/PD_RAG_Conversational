Title: Reward and Punishment Learning as Predictors of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Response in Parkinson's Disease Comorbid with Clinical Depression.
PMID: 38158704

Abstract:
Depression is highly comorbid among individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD), who often experience unique challenges to accessing and benefitting from empirically supported interventions like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Given the role of reward processing in both depression and PD, this study analyzed a subset (N = 25) of participants who participated in a pilot telemedicine intervention of PD-informed CBT, and also completed a Reward- and Punishment-Learning Task (RPLT) at baseline. At the conclusion of CBT, participants were categorized into treatment responders (n = 14) and non-responders (n = 11). Responders learned more optimally from negative rather than positive feedback on the RPLT, while this pattern was reversed in non-responders. Computational modeling suggested group differences in learning rate to negative feedback may drive the observed differences. Overall, the results suggest that a within-subject bias for punishment-based learning might help to predict response to CBT intervention for depression in those with PD.<b>Plain Language Summary</b> Performance on a Computerized Task may predict which Parkinson's Disease Patients benefit from Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Clinical Depression<b>Why was the study done?</b> Clinical depression regularly arises in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) due to the neurobiological changes with the onset and progression of the disease as well as the unique psychosocial difficulties associated with living with a chronic condition. Nonetheless, psychiatric disorders among individuals with PD are often underdiagnosed and likewise undertreated for a variety of reasons. The results of our study have implications about how to improve the accuracy and specificity of mental health treatment recommendations in the future to maximize benefits for individuals with PD, who often face additional barriers to accessing quality mental health treatment.<b>What did the researchers do?</b> We explored whether performance on a computerized task called the Reward- and Punishment-Learning Task (RPLT) helped to predict response to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for depression better than other predictors identified in previous studies. Twenty-five individuals with PD and clinical depression that completed a 10-week telehealth CBT program were assessed for: Demographics (Age, gender, etc.); Clinical information (PD duration, mental health diagnoses, levels of anxiety/depression, etc.); Neurocognitive performance (Memory, processing speed, impulse control, etc.); and RPLT performance.<b>What did the researchers find?</b> A total of 14 participants significantly benefitted from CBT treatment while 11 did not significantly benefit from treatment.There were no differences before treatment in the demographics, clinical information, and neurocognitive performance of those participants who ended up benefitting from the treatment versus those who did not.There were, however, differences before treatment in RPLT performance so that those individuals that benefitted from CBT seemed to learn better from negative feedback.<b>What do the findings mean?</b> Our results suggest that the CBT program benefitted those PD patients with clinical depression that seemed to overall learn best from avoiding punishment rather than obtaining reward which was targeted in CBT by focusing on increasing engagement in rewarding activities. The Reward- and Punishment-Learning Task hence may be a useful tool to help predict treatment response and provide more individualized recommendations on how to best maximize the benefits of psychotherapy for individuals with PD that may struggle to connect to mental health care. Caution is recommended about interpretating these results beyond this study as the overall number of participants was small and the data for this study were collected as part of a previous study so there was no opportunity to include additional measurements of interest.
