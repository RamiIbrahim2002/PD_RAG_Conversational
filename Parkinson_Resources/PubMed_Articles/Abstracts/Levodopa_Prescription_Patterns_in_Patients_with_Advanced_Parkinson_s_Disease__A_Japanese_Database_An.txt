Title: Levodopa Prescription Patterns in Patients with Advanced Parkinson's Disease: A Japanese Database Analysis.
PMID: 37799489

Abstract:
Prescription doses of levodopa in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) are generally lower in Japan than in the United States or Europe, although Japanese guidelines for the management of PD recommend increasing the dosage as the disease progresses. However, data regarding levodopa prescription practices in patients with advanced PD in the clinical setting are limited. This retrospective observational study analyzed patterns of drug use for patients with advanced PD in Japan using claims data from hospitalized patients in the Medical Data Vision Co. database. Eligible patients had at least two PD-associated claims in two different quarters between April 1, 2008, and November 30, 2018, and a 10-item activities of daily living score <60 upon hospital discharge (as a proxy for advanced PD). The primary endpoint was the prescribed dosage of levodopa at the index hospitalization. Dosages of other PD drugs (medications with an on-label indication for PD) and non-PD drugs were also assessed. Overall, 4029 patients met the inclusion criteria (mean age, 76.9 years; 83.3% aged ≥70 years). At the index date, 74.0% were receiving levodopa. Patients received a median of one PD drug in addition to levodopa, and 27.4% and 20.2% received one or two concomitant PD drugs, respectively. Patients received a median of two non-PD drugs. The median levodopa dosage and total levodopa equivalent dosage (LED) at the index hospitalization were 418.2 and 634.8 mg/day (adjusted for body weight, 9.0 and 13.7 mg/kg/day), respectively. The median levodopa and total LED dosage in each 6-month increment during the 5 years before and after the index date ranged between 263.9 and 330.2 mg/day (5.0 and 6.5 mg/kg/day) and 402.0 and 504.9 mg/day (8.3 and 10.1 mg/kg/day), respectively. This study suggests that many Japanese patients with advanced PD could receive more intensive treatment with higher doses of levodopa.
