Abstract:
Red ginseng (RG) is widely used as a herbal medicine. As the human lifespan has increased, numerous diseases have developed, and RG has also been used to treat various diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases are major problems that modern people face through their lives. Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are featured by progressive nerve system damage. Recently, neuroinflammation has emerged as a degenerative factor and is an immune response in which cytokines with nerve cells that constitute the nervous system. RG, a natural herbal medicine with fewer side effects than chemically synthesized drugs, is currently in the spotlight. Therefore, we reviewed studies reporting the roles of RG in treating neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases and found that RG might help alleviate neurodegenerative diseases by regulating neuroinflammation.
