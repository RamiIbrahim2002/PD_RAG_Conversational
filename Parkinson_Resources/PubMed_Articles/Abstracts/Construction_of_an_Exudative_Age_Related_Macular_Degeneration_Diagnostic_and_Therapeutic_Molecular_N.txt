Abstract:
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment in the elderly. The current management of nAMD is limited and involves regular intravitreal administration of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF). However, the effectiveness of these treatments is limited by overlapping and compensatory pathways leading to unresponsiveness to anti-VEGF treatments in a significant portion of nAMD patients. Therefore, a system view of pathways involved in pathophysiology of nAMD will have significant clinical value. The aim of this study was to identify proteins, miRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), various metabolites, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a significant role in the pathogenesis of nAMD. To accomplish this goal, we conducted a multi-layer network analysis, which identified 30 key genes, six miRNAs, and four lncRNAs. We also found three key metabolites that are common with AMD, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia. Moreover, we identified nine key SNPs and their related genes that are common among AMD, AD, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, our findings suggest that there exists a connection between nAMD and the aforementioned neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, our study also demonstrates the effectiveness of using artificial intelligence, specifically the LSTM network, a fuzzy logic model, and genetic algorithms, to identify important metabolites in complex metabolic pathways to open new avenues for the design and/or repurposing of drugs for nAMD treatment.
