Abstract:
Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and α-synuclein share enigmatic roles in the pathobiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). <i>LRRK2</i> mutations are a common genetic cause of PD which, in addition to neurodegeneration, often present with abnormal deposits of α-synuclein in the form of Lewy-related pathology. As Lewy-related pathology is a prominent neuropathologic finding in sporadic PD, the relationship between LRRK2 and α-synuclein has garnered considerable interest. However, whether and how LRRK2 might influence the accumulation of Lewy-related pathology remains poorly understood. Through stereotactic injection of mouse α-synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFF), we modeled the spread of Lewy-related pathology within forebrain regions where LRRK2 is most highly expressed. The impact of <i>LRRK2</i> genotype on the formation of α-synuclein inclusions was evaluated at 1-month post-injection. Neither deletion of <i>LRRK2</i> nor G2019S LRRK2 knockin appreciably altered the burden of α-synuclein pathology at this early timepoint. These observations fail to provide support for a robust pathophysiologic interaction between LRRK2 and α-synuclein in the forebrain <i>in vivo</i>. There was, however, a modest reduction in microglial activation induced by PFF delivery in the hippocampus of <i>LRRK2</i> knockout mice, suggesting that LRRK2 may contribute to α-synuclein-induced neuroinflammation. Collectively, our data indicate that the pathological accumulation of α-synuclein in the mouse forebrain is largely independent of LRRK2.
