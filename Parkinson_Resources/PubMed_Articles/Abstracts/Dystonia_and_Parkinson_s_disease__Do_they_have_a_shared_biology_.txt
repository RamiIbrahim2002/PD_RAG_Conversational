Title: Dystonia and Parkinson's disease: Do they have a shared biology?
PMID: 37482398

Abstract:
Parkinsonism and dystonia co-occur across many movement disorders and are most encountered in the setting of Parkinson's disease. Here we aim to explore the shared neurobiological underpinnings of dystonia and parkinsonism through the clinical lens of the conditions in which these movement disorders can be seen together. Foregrounding the discussion, we briefly review the circuits of the motor system and the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological aspects of motor control and highlight their relevance to the proposed pathophysiology of parkinsonism and dystonia. Insight into shared biology is then sought from dystonia occurring in PD and other forms of parkinsonism including those disorders in which both can be co-expressed simultaneously. We organize these within a biological schema along with important questions to be addressed in this space.
