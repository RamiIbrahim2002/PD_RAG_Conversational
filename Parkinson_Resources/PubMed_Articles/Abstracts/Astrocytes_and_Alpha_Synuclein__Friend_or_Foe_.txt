Title: Astrocytes and Alpha-Synuclein: Friend or Foe?
PMID: 38007674

Abstract:
Despite its devastating disease burden and alarming prevalence, the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains to be completely elucidated. PD is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and this correlates with the accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein. While the aggregation of α-synuclein in the form of Lewy bodies or Lewy neurites is a well-established intraneuronal hallmark of the disease process, our understanding of the glial contribution to aberrant α-synuclein proteostasis is lacking. In this regard, restoring astrocyte function during early PD could offer a promising therapeutic avenue and understanding the involvement of astrocytes in handling/mishandling of α-synuclein is of particular interest. Here, we explore the growing body of scientific literature implicating aberrant astrocytic α-synuclein proteostasis with the seemingly inexorable pathological sequelae typifying PD. We also provide a perspective on how heterogeneity in the morphological relationship between astrocytes and neurons will need to be considered in the context of PD pathogenesis.
