Title: Perception of cognitive change by individuals with Parkinson's disease or essential tremor seeking deep brain stimulation: Utility of the cognitive change index.
PMID: 37800314

Abstract:
The Cognitive Change Index (CCI-20) is a validated questionnaire that assesses subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) across memory, language, and executive domains. We aimed to: (a) examine the internal consistency and construct validity of the CCI-20 in patients with movement disorders and (b) learn how the CCI-20 corresponds to objective neuropsychological and mood performance in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) or essential tremor (ET) seeking deep brain stimulation (DBS).
