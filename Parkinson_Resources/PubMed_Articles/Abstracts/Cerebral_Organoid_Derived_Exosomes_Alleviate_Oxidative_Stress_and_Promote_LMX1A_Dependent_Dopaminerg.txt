Title: Cerebral-Organoid-Derived Exosomes Alleviate Oxidative Stress and Promote LMX1A-Dependent Dopaminergic Differentiation.
PMID: 37446226

Abstract:
The remarkable advancements related to cerebral organoids have provided unprecedented opportunities to model human brain development and diseases. However, despite their potential significance in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), the role of exosomes from cerebral organoids (OExo) has been largely unknown. In this study, we compared the effects of OExo to those of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes (CExo) and found that OExo shared similar neuroprotective effects to CExo. Our findings showed that OExo mitigated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in rat midbrain astrocytes by reducing excess ROS production, antioxidant depletion, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the expression of pro-apoptotic genes. Notably, OExo demonstrated superiority over CExo in promoting the differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into dopaminergic (DA) neurons. This was attributed to the higher abundance of neurotrophic factors, including neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) and glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), in OExo, which facilitated the iPSCs' differentiation into DA neurons in an LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 alpha (LMX1A)-dependent manner. Our study provides novel insight into the biological properties of cerebral organoids and highlights the potential of OExo in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD.
