Title: Deferoxamine Ameliorates Cypermethrin-Induced Iron Accumulation and Associated Alterations.
PMID: 38064103

Abstract:
Iron is widely linked with the onset and development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Accumulation of iron induces free radical generation and promotes α-synuclein aggregation, oxidative stress, and autophagy impairment. Deferoxamine, an iron chelator, is shown to ameliorate iron dyshomeostasis in rodents and humans. However, the role of deferoxamine in cypermethrin-induced iron accumulation is not yet known. Although an iron accumulation and impaired chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) contribute to PD, a link between the two is not yet widely understood. Current study is undertaken to explore the possible association between an iron accumulation and CMA in cypermethrin model of PD in the presence of deferoxamine. Level of iron, iron transporter proteins, oxidative stress, and CMA proteins along with indicators of Parkinsonism were measured. Deferoxamine attenuated cypermethrin-induced iron accumulation and number of iron-positive cells and ameliorated the demise of dopaminergic cells and dopamine content. Deferoxamine significantly normalizes cypermethrin-induced changes in iron transporter proteins, α-synuclein, lysosome-associated membrane protein-2A, and oxidative stress. The results demonstrate that deferoxamine ameliorates cypermethrin-induced iron dyshomeostasis and impairment in CMA.
