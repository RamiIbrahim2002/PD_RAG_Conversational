Title: Entropy-Based Machine Learning Model for Fast Diagnosis and Monitoring of Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37896703

Abstract:
This study presents the concept of a computationally efficient machine learning (ML) model for diagnosing and monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD) using rest-state EEG signals (rs-EEG) from 20 PD subjects and 20 normal control (NC) subjects at a sampling rate of 128 Hz. Based on the comparative analysis of the effectiveness of entropy calculation methods, fuzzy entropy showed the best results in diagnosing and monitoring PD using rs-EEG, with classification accuracy (<i>A</i><sub>RKF</sub>) of ~99.9%. The most important frequency range of rs-EEG for PD-based diagnostics lies in the range of 0-4 Hz, and the most informative signals were mainly received from the right hemisphere of the head. It was also found that <i>A</i><sub>RKF</sub> significantly decreased as the length of rs-EEG segments decreased from 1000 to 150 samples. Using a procedure for selecting the most informative features, it was possible to reduce the computational costs of classification by 11 times, while maintaining an <i>A</i><sub>RKF</sub> ~99.9%. The proposed method can be used in the healthcare internet of things (H-IoT), where low-performance edge devices can implement ML sensors to enhance human resilience to PD.
