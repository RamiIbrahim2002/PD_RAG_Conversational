Title: Tetramethylpyrazine nitrone exerts neuroprotection via activation of PGC-1Î±/Nrf2 pathway in Parkinson's disease models.
PMID: 37989471

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is common neurodegenerative disease where oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction play important roles in its progression. Tetramethylpyrazine nitrone (TBN), a potent free radical scavenger, has shown protective effects in various neurological conditions. However, the neuroprotective mechanisms of TBN in PD models remain unclear.
