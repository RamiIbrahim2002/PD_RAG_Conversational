Title: Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Accelerate the Rate of Insulin Aggregation and Enhance Toxicity of Insulin Aggregates.
PMID: 38127718

Abstract:
Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) are essential components of a human diet. These molecules are critically important for cognitive attention and memory, mood states, coronary circulation, and cirrhosis. However, recently reported findings demonstrated that docosahexaenoic (DHA) and arachidonic acids (ARA), ω-3 and ω-6 LCPUFAs, accelerated the aggregation rates of insulin and α-synuclein, proteins that are directly linked to diabetes type 2 and Parkinson's disease, respectively. Furthermore, both DHA and ARA uniquely altered the structure and toxicity of the corresponding protein aggregates. Our objective is to ascertain whether other LCPUFAs, alongside long-chain unsaturated fatty acid (LCUFA) proteins, exhibit similar effects on amyloidogenic proteins. To explore this matter, we investigated the effect of 10 different LCPUFAs and LCUFAs on the rate of insulin aggregation. We found that all of the analyzed fatty acids strongly accelerated insulin aggregation. Moreover, we found that protein aggregates that were formed in the presence of these fatty acids exerted significantly higher cell toxicity compared with insulin fibrils grown in the lipid-free environment. These findings show that interactions between amyloid-associated proteins and LCPUFAs can be the underlying molecular cause of neurodegenerative diseases.
