Title: Calcineurin inhibition protects against dopamine toxicity and attenuates behavioral decline in a Parkinson's disease model.
PMID: 37528492

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD), a highly prevalent neuro-motor disorder is caused due to progressive loss of dopaminergicÂ (DAergic) neurons at substantia nigra region of brain. This leads to depleted dopamine (DA) content at striatum, thus affecting the fine tuning of basal ganglia. In patients, this imbalance is manifested by akinesia, catalepsy and tremor. PD associated behavioral dysfunctions are frequently mitigated by l-DOPA (LD) therapy, a precursor for DA synthesis. Due to progressive neurodegeneration, LD eventually loses applicability in PD. Although DA is cytotoxic, it is unclear whether LD therapy can accelerate PD progression or not. LD itself does not lead to neurodegeneration in vivo, but previous reports demonstrate that LD treatment mediated excess DA can potentiate neurotoxicity when PD associated genetic or epigenetic aberrations are involved. So, minimizing DA toxicity during the therapy is an absolute necessity to halt or slowdown PD progression. The two major contributing factors associated with DA toxicity are: degradation by Monoamine oxidase and DAquinone (DAQ) formation.
