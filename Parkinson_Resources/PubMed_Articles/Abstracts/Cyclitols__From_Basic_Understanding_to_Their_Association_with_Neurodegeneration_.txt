Title: Cyclitols: From Basic Understanding to Their Association with Neurodegeneration.
PMID: 37432155

Abstract:
One of the most common cyclitols found in eukaryotic cells-Myo-inositol (MI) and its derivatives play a key role in many cellular processes such as ion channel physiology, signal transduction, phosphate storage, cell wall formation, membrane biogenesis and osmoregulation. The aim of this paper is to characterize the possibility of neurodegenerative disorders treatment using MI and the research of other therapeutic methods linked to MI's derivatives. Based on the reviewed literature the researchers focus on the most common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Spinocerebellar ataxias, but there are also works describing other seldom encountered diseases. The use of MI, d-pinitol and other methods altering MI's metabolism, although research on this topic has been conducted for years, still needs much closer examination. The dietary supplementation of MI shows a promising effect on the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and can be of great help in alleviating the accompanying depressive symptoms.
