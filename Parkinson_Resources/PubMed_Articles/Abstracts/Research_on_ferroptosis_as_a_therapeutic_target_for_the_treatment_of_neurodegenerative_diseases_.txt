Title: Research on ferroptosis as a therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
PMID: 37619619

Abstract:
Ferroptosis is an iron- and lipid peroxidation (LPO)-mediated programmed cell death type. Recently, mounting evidence has indicated the involvement of ferroptosis in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and so on. Treating ferroptosis presents opportunities as well as challenges for neurodegenerative diseases. This review provides a comprehensive overview of typical features of ferroptosis and the underlying mechanisms that contribute to its occurrence, as well as their implications in the pathogenesis and advancement of major neurodegenerative disorders. Meanwhile, we summarize the utilization of ferroptosis inhibition in both experimental and clinical approaches for the treatment of major neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, we specifically summarize recent advances in developing therapeutic means targeting ferroptosis in these diseases, which may guide future approaches for the effective management of these devastating medical conditions.
