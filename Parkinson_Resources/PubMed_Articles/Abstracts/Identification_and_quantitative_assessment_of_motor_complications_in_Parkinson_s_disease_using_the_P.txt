Title: Identification and quantitative assessment of motor complications in Parkinson's disease using the Parkinson's KinetiGraph™.
PMID: 37593376

Abstract:
Effective management and therapies for the motor complications of Parkinson's disease (PD) require appropriate clinical evaluation. The Parkinson's KinetiGraph™ (PKG) is a wearable biosensor system that can record the motion characteristics of PD objectively and remotely.
