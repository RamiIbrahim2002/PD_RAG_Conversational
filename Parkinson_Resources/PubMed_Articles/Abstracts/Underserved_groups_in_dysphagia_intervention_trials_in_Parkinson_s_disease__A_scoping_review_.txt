Title: Underserved groups in dysphagia intervention trials in Parkinson's disease: A scoping review.
PMID: 38043779

Abstract:
Underserved groups in Parkinson's disease (PD) intervention studies are well recognised. However, it remains unclear whether these exclusions apply to oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) intervention studies in PD. The aim of this scoping review was to identify characteristics of included participants and underserved groups in intervention studies in OD in PD.
