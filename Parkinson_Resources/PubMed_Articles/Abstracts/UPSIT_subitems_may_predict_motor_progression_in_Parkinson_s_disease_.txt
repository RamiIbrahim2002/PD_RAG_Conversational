Title: UPSIT subitems may predict motor progression in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37936914

Abstract:
The relationship between hyposmia and motor progression is controversial in Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether preserved identification of Chinese-validated University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) odors could predict PD motor progression.
