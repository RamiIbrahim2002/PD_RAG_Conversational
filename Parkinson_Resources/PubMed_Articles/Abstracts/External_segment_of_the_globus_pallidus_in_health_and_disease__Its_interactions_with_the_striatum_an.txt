Title: External segment of the globus pallidus in health and disease: Its interactions with the striatum and subthalamic nucleus.
PMID: 37992783

Abstract:
The external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) has long been considered a homogeneous structure that receives inputs from the striatum and sends processed information to the subthalamic nucleus, composing a relay nucleus of the indirect pathway that contributes to movement suppression. Recent methodological revolution in rodents led to the identification of two distinct cell types in the GPe with different fiber connections. The GPe may be regarded as a dynamic, complex and influential center within the basal ganglia circuitry, rather than a simple relay nucleus. On the other hand, many studies have so far been performed in monkeys to clarify the functions of the basal ganglia in the healthy and diseased states, but have not paid much attention to such classification and functional differences of GPe neurons. In this minireview, we consider the knowledge on the rodent GPe and discuss its impact on the understanding of the basal ganglia circuitry in monkeys.
