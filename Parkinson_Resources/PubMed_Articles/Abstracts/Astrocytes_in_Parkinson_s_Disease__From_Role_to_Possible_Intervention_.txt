Title: Astrocytes in Parkinson's Disease: From Role to Possible Intervention.
PMID: 37830550

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. While neuronal dysfunction is central to PD, astrocytes also play important roles, both positive and negative, and such roles have not yet been fully explored. This literature review serves to highlight these roles and how the properties of astrocytes can be used to increase neuron survivability. Astrocytes normally have protective functions, such as releasing neurotrophic factors, metabolizing glutamate, transferring healthy mitochondria to neurons, or maintaining the blood-brain barrier. However, in PD, astrocytes can become dysfunctional and contribute to neurotoxicity, e.g., via impaired glutamate metabolism or the release of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, astrocytes represent a double-edged sword. Restoring healthy astrocyte function and increasing the beneficial effects of astrocytes represents a promising therapeutic approach. Strategies such as promoting neurotrophin release, preventing harmful astrocyte reactivity, or utilizing regional astrocyte diversity may help restore neuroprotection.
