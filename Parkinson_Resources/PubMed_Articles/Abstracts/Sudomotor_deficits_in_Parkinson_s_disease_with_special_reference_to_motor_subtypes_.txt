Title: Sudomotor deficits in Parkinson's disease with special reference to motor subtypes.
PMID: 37540935

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease which shows clinically heterogeneous motor derangement may also accompany various autonomic disorders, but results of previous research on incidence and degree of each autonomic dysfunction have been inconsistent. As for sudomotor dysfunction, some investigators emphasize hypo- or anhidrois, whereas others stress hyperhidrosis.
