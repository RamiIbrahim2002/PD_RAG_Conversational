Title: Roles of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Managing Cognitive Impairment in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Review.
PMID: 37892438

Abstract:
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contributes significantly to the death of people worldwide, especially the elderly. An essential feature of COPD is pulmonary inflammation, which results from long-term exposure to noxious substances from cigarette smoking and other environmental pollutants. Pulmonary inflammatory mediators spill over to the blood, leading to systemic inflammation, which is believed to play a significant role in the onset of a host of comorbidities associated with COPD. A substantial comorbidity of concern in COPD patients that is often overlooked in COPD management is cognitive impairment. The exact pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in COPD patients remains a mystery; however, hypoxia, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and cerebral manifestations of these conditions are believed to play crucial roles. Furthermore, the use of medications to treat cognitive impairment symptomatology in COPD patients has been reported to be associated with life-threatening adverse effects, hence the need for alternative medications with reduced side effects. In this Review, we aim to discuss the impact of cognitive impairment in COPD management and the potential mechanisms associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment in COPD patients. The promising roles of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) in improving cognitive deficits in COPD patients are also discussed. Interestingly, ω-3 PUFAs can potentially enhance the cognitive impairment symptomatology associated with COPD because they can modulate inflammatory processes, activate the antioxidant defence system, and promote amyloid-beta clearance from the brain. Thus, clinical studies are crucial to assess the efficacy of ω-3 PUFAs in managing cognitive impairment in COPD patients.
