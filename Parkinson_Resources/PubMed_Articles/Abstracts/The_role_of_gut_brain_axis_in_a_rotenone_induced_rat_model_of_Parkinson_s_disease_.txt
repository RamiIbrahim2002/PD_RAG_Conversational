Title: The role of gut-brain axis in a rotenone-induced rat model of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37837734

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a widespread neurodegenerative condition affecting millions globally. This investigation centered on the gut-brain axis in a rotenone-induced PD rat model. Researchers monitored behavioral shifts, histological modifications, neurodegeneration, and inflammation markers throughout the rats' bodies. Results revealed that rotenone-treated rats displayed reduced exploration (p = 0.004) and motor coordination (p < 0.001), accompanied by decreased Nissl staining and increased alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in the striatum (p = 0.009). Additionally, these rats exhibited weight loss (T3, mean = 291.9 ± 23.67; T19, mean = 317.5 ± 17.53; p < 0.05) and substantial intestinal histological alterations, such as shortened villi, crypt architecture loss, and inflammation. In various regions, researchers noted elevated immunoreactivity to ionized binding adapter molecule (IBA)-1 (p < 0.05) and reduced immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein (p < 0.05) and S100B (p < 0.001), indicating altered glial cell activity. Overall, these findings imply that PD is influenced by gut-brain axis changes and may originate in the intestine, impacting bidirectional gut-brain communication.
