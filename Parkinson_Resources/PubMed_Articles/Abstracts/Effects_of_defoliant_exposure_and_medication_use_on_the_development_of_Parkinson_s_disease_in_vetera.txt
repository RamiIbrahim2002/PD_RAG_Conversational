Title: Effects of defoliant exposure and medication use on the development of Parkinson's disease in veterans.
PMID: 37890520

Abstract:
Vietnam-era veterans were exposed to Agent Orange (AO), which is associated with a high prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, little is known about the development of PD-like symptoms caused by drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) in such populations. This study aimed to investigate PD incidence and PD risk following exposure to AO or DIP-risk drugs in veterans.
