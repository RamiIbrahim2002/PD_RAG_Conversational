Abstract:
There is evidence that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) involve in the development of Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms and loss of dopaminergic neurons in which the error index (<i>EI</i>) in firing patterns is widely used to address the related issues. Whether and how this interaction mechanism of STN and GPe affects <i>EI</i> in Parkinson's disease is uncertain. To account for this, we propose a kind of basal ganglia-thalamic network model associated with Parkinson's disease coupled with neurons, and investigate the effect of synaptic conductance of STN and GPe on <i>EI</i> in this network, as well as their internal relationship under <i>EI</i> as an index. The results show a relationship like a piecewise function between the error index and the slope of the state transition function of synaptic conductance from STN to GPe ( <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>g</mi> <mrow><mi>snge</mi></mrow> </msub> </math> ) and from GPe to STN ( <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>g</mi> <mrow><mi>gesn</mi></mrow> </msub> </math> ). And there is an approximate negative correlation between <i>EI</i> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>g</mi> <mrow><mi>gesn</mi></mrow> </msub> </math> . Increasing <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>g</mi> <mrow><mi>snge</mi></mrow> </msub> </math> and decreasing <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>g</mi> <mrow><mi>gesn</mi></mrow> </msub> </math> can improve the fidelity of thalamus information transmission and alleviate Parkinson's disease effectively. These obtained results can give some theoretical evidence that the abnormal synaptic releases of STN and GPe may be the symptoms of the development of Parkinson's disease, and further enrich the understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment mechanism of Parkinson's disease.
