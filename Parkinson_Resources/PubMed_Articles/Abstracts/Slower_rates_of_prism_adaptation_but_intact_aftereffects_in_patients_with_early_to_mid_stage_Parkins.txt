Title: Slower rates of prism adaptation but intact aftereffects in patients with early to mid-stage Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37709193

Abstract:
There is currently mixed evidence on the effect of Parkinson's disease on motor adaptation. Some studies report that patients display adaptation comparable to age-matched controls, while others report a complete inability to adapt to novel sensory perturbations. Here, early to mid-stage Parkinson's patients were recruited to perform a prism adaptation task. When compared to controls, patients showed slower rates of initial adaptation but intact aftereffects. These results support the suggestion that patients with early to mid-stage Parkinson's disease display intact adaptation driven by sensory prediction errors, as shown by the intact aftereffect. But impaired facilitation of performance through cognitive strategies informed by task error, as shown by the impaired initial adaptation. These results support recent studies that suggest that patients with Parkinson's disease retain the ability to perform visuomotor adaptation, but display altered use of cognitive strategies to aid performance and generalises these previous findings to the classical prism adaptation task.
