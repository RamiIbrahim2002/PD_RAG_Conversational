Title: Association of serum uric acid levels with bone mineral density and the presence of osteoporosis in Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease: a cross-sectional study.
PMID: 37420115

Abstract:
As the population ages, the incidence of osteoporosis among patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) will surge continually, and the ensuing disability from falls is becoming a serious social burden. Due to its antioxidant properties, much literature has indicated the possible ability of serum uric acid (UA) to prevent ageing-related diseases caused by oxidative stress, including osteoporosis and PD. Therefore, this study was for exploring the connection of serum UA levels with bone mineral density (BMD) and the osteoporosis presence in Chinese PD patients.
