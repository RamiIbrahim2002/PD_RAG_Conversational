Title: Consequences of Disturbing Manganese Homeostasis.
PMID: 37834407

Abstract:
Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element with unique functions in the body; it acts as a cofactor for many enzymes involved in energy metabolism, the endogenous antioxidant enzyme systems, neurotransmitter production, and the regulation of reproductive hormones. However, overexposure to Mn is toxic, particularly to the central nervous system (CNS) due to it causing the progressive destruction of nerve cells. Exposure to manganese is widespread and occurs by inhalation, ingestion, or dermal contact. Associations have been observed between Mn accumulation and neurodegenerative diseases such as manganism, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. People with genetic diseases associated with a mutation in the gene associated with impaired Mn excretion, kidney disease, iron deficiency, or a vegetarian diet are at particular risk of excessive exposure to Mn. This review has collected data on the current knowledge of the source of Mn exposure, the experimental data supporting the dispersive accumulation of Mn in the brain, the controversies surrounding the reference values of biomarkers related to Mn status in different matrices, and the competitiveness of Mn with other metals, such as iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), calcium (Ca). The disturbed homeostasis of Mn in the body has been connected with susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases, fertility, and infectious diseases. The current evidence on the involvement of Mn in metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus/insulin resistance, osteoporosis, obesity, atherosclerosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, was collected and discussed.
