PMID: 37717841

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second neurodegenerative disease that lacks effective treatments. Buddlejasaponin IVb (BJP-IVb) is the main bioactive component of herbs in genus Clinopodium which display antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. However, the role of BJP-IVb in PD still remains unknown.
