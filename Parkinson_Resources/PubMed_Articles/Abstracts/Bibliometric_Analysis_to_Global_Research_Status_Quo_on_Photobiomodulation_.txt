Title: Bibliometric Analysis to Global Research Status Quo on Photobiomodulation.
PMID: 38011736

Abstract:
<b><i>Background:</i></b> Photobiomodulation (PBM) becomes a remedial technology with growing popularity. The primary goal of this article is to conduct a PBM literature review, providing an overall systematic understanding of current and future trends. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A dataset was made with topic retrieval, concerning PBM research retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. We analyzed to forecast research frontiers in this field using the softwares: VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Biblioshiny. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Four thousand five hundred thirty pieces of literature were retrieved from our database. Current trends were characterized by keywords of "light," "spinal cord injury," "skeletal muscle," and so on. Future trends were characterized probably by six cutting-edge terms: "wound healing," "pain," "oral mucositis," "Alzheimer's disease," "Parkinson's disease," and "orthodontics." <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> This study finds that the inadequacy of in-depth reliable interpretation of current clinical data calls for molecular biological mechanisms together with well-designed, large-sample, multicenter clinical trials. The study of oral, wound, and neural-related mechanisms and the exploration of therapeutic effects may be the popular trend at present and in the next few years.
