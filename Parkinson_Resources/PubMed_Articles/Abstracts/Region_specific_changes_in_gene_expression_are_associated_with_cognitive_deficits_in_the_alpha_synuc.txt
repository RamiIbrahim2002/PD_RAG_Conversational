Abstract:
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common trait of Parkinson's disease (PD), often associated with early motor deficits, eventually evolving to PD with dementia in later disease stages. The neuropathological substrate of MCI is poorly understood, which weakens the development and administration of proper therapies. In an α-synuclein (αSyn)-based model of PD featuring early motor and cognitive impairments, we investigated the transcriptome profile of brain regions involved in PD with cognitive deficits, via a transcriptomic analysis based on RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. Rats infused in the substantia nigra with human α-synuclein oligomers (H-SynOs) developed mild cognitive deficits after three months, as measured by the two-trial recognition test in a Y-maze and the novel object recognition test. RNA-seq analysis showed that 17,436 genes were expressed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and 17,216 genes in the hippocampus (HC). In the ACC, 51 genes were differentially expressed between vehicle and H-αSynOs treated samples, which showed N= 21 upregulated and N = 30 downregulated genes. In the HC, 104 genes were differentially expressed, the majority of them not overlapping with DEGs in the ACC, with N = 41 upregulated and N = 63 downregulated in H-αSynOs-treated samples. The Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, followed by the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network inspection of DEGs, revealed that in the ACC most enriched terms were related with immune functions, specifically with antigen processing/presentation via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and phagocytosis via CD68, supporting a role for dysregulated immune responses in early PD cognitive dysfunction. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the decreased expression of CD68 within microglial cells. In contrast, the most significantly enriched terms in the HC were mainly involved in mitochondrial homeostasis, potassium voltage-gated channel, cytoskeleton and fiber organisation, suggesting that the gene expression in the neuronal population was mostly affected in this region in early disease stages. Altogether results show that H-αSynOs trigger a region-specific dysregulation of gene expression in ACC and HC, providing a pathological substrate for MCI associated with early PD.
