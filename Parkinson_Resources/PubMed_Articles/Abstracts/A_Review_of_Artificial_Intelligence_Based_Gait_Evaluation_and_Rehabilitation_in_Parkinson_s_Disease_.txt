PMID: 38021909

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a long-term degenerative disease of the central nervous system that affects both motor and non-motor functions. In most cases, symptoms develop gradually, with non-motor symptoms increasing in frequency as the condition progresses. Tremors, stiffness, slow movements, and difficulty walking are some of the early symptoms. There may be problems with cognition, behavior, sleep, and thinking. Dementia caused by PD becomes more common as the disease progresses. The development of PD is linked to certain sequences of motion that eventually contribute to diminished function. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PWPD) have a sluggish, scattered gait that is accompanied by intermittent freezing of gait (FOG), in which efficient heading briefly pauses. In individuals with severe PD, FOG is a neurological deficit that is related to falls and has an unfavorable impact on the patient's standard of living. Artificial intelligence (AI) and ambient intelligence (AmI) are inextricably linked as intelligence is the ability to gain new information and employ it in novel contexts. The ambience is what accompanies us, while artificial represents something developed by humans. Wearable technologies are being designed to recognize FOG and support patients in the beginning to walk again via periodic cueing. The article proposes a unique automated approach for action description that utilizes AI to carry out a non-intrusive, markerless evaluation in real-time and with full robotics. This computerized method accelerates detection and safeguards from human error. Despite significant improvements brought about by the advent of novel technologies, the available assessment platforms still fail to strike the ideal equilibrium among expenditure, diagnostic precision, velocity, and simplicity. The value of the recommended approach can be seen through a comparison of the gait parameters collected by each of the motion-tracking gadgets.
