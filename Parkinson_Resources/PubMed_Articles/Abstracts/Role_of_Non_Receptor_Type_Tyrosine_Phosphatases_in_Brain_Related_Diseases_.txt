Title: Role of Non-Receptor-Type Tyrosine Phosphatases in Brain-Related Diseases.
PMID: 37458988

Abstract:
The non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase is a class of enzymes that catalyze the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosines in protein molecules. They are involved in cellular signaling by regulating the phosphorylation status of a variety of receptors and signaling molecules within the cell, thereby influencing cellular physiological and pathological processes. In this article, we detail multiple non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase and non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase genes involved in the pathological process of brain disease. These include PTPN6, PTPN11, and PTPN13, which are involved in glioma signaling; PTPN1, PTPN5, and PTPN13, which are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease Tau protein lesions, PTPN23, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of Epilepsy and PTPN1, which is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. The role of mitochondrial tyrosine phosphatase in brain diseases was also discussed. Non-receptor tyrosine phosphatases have great potential for targeted therapies in brain diseases and are highly promising research areas.
