Title: Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease with glucocerebrosidase mutations: prevalence, clinical correlates and effect on quality of life.
PMID: 38089969

Abstract:
Mutations in glucocerebrosidase (<i>GBA1</i>) can change the clinical phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to explore the clinical characteristics of freezing of gait (FOG) in PD patients with <i>GBA1</i> mutations.
