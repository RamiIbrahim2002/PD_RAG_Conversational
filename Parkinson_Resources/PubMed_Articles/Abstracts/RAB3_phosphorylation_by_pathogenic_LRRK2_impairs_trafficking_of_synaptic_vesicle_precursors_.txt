Title: RAB3 phosphorylation by pathogenic LRRK2 impairs trafficking of synaptic vesicle precursors.
PMID: 37546777

Abstract:
Gain-of-function mutations in the <i>LRRK2</i> gene cause Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by debilitating motor and non-motor symptoms. Increased phosphorylation of a subset of RAB GTPases by LRRK2 is implicated in PD pathogenesis. We find that increased phosphorylation of RAB3A, a cardinal synaptic vesicle precursor (SVP) protein, disrupts anterograde axonal transport of SVPs in iPSC-derived human neurons (iNeurons) expressing hyperactive <i>LRRK2</i>-p.R1441H. Knockout of the opposing protein phosphatase 1H (<i>PPM1H</i>) in iNeurons phenocopies this effect. In these models, the compartmental distribution of synaptic proteins is altered; synaptophysin and synaptobrevin-2 become sequestered in the neuronal soma with decreased delivery to presynaptic sites along the axon. We find that RAB3A phosphorylation disrupts binding to the motor adapter MADD, potentially preventing formation of the RAB3A-MADD-KIF1A/1BÎ² complex driving anterograde SVP transport. RAB3A hyperphosphorylation also disrupts interactions with RAB3GAP and RAB-GDI1. Our results reveal a mechanism by which pathogenic hyperactive LRRK2 may contribute to the altered synaptic homeostasis associated with characteristic non-motor and cognitive manifestations of PD.
