Title: Pupil light reflex dynamics in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37727653

Abstract:
Visual disturbance is common symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), and defective pupil light reflex (PLR) is an anticipated contributing factor that may be associated to the presence of autonomic dysfunction, which is a common non-motor feature of PD. Studies investigating the intercorrelation between PLR and dysautonomia in PD are limited.
