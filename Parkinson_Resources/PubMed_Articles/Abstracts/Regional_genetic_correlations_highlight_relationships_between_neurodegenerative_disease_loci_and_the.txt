Title: Regional genetic correlations highlight relationships between neurodegenerative disease loci and the immune system.
PMID: 37454237

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are devastating complex diseases resulting in physical and psychological burdens on patients and their families. There have been important efforts to understand their genetic basis leading to the identification of disease risk-associated loci involved in several molecular mechanisms, including immune-related pathways. Regional, in contrast to genome-wide, genetic correlations between pairs of immune and neurodegenerative traits have not been comprehensively explored, but could uncover additional immune-mediated risk-associated loci. Here, we systematically assess the role of the immune system in five neurodegenerative diseases by estimating regional genetic correlations between these diseases and immune-cell-derived single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTLs). We also investigate correlations between diseases and protein levels. We observe significant (FDR < 0.01) correlations between sc-eQTLs and neurodegenerative diseases across 151 unique genes, spanning both the innate and adaptive immune systems, across most diseases tested. With Parkinson's, for instance, RAB7L1 in CD4+ naïve T cells is positively correlated and KANSL1-AS1 is negatively correlated across all adaptive immune cell types. Follow-up colocalization highlight candidate causal risk genes. The outcomes of this study will improve our understanding of the immune component of neurodegeneration, which can warrant repurposing of existing immunotherapies to slow disease progression.
