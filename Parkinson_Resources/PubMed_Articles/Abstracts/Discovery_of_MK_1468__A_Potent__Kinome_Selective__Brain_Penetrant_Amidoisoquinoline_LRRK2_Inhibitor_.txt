Title: Discovery of MK-1468: A Potent, Kinome-Selective, Brain-Penetrant Amidoisoquinoline LRRK2 Inhibitor for the Potential Treatment of Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37861679

Abstract:
Genetic mutation of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) protein has been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), a disabling and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is devoid of efficacious disease-modifying therapies. Herein, we describe the invention of an amidoisoquinoline (IQ)-derived LRRK2 inhibitor lead chemical series. Knowledge-, structure-, and property-based drug design in concert with rigorous application of <i>in silico</i> calculations and presynthesis predictions enabled the prioritization of molecules with favorable CNS "drug-like" physicochemical properties. This resulted in the discovery of compound <b>8</b>, which was profiled extensively before human ether-a-go-go (hERG) ion channel inhibition halted its progression. Strategic reduction of lipophilicity and basicity resulted in attenuation of hERG ion channel inhibition while maintaining a favorable CNS efflux transporter profile. Further structure- and property-based optimizations resulted in the discovery of preclinical candidate <b>MK-1468</b>. This exquisitely selective LRRK2 inhibitor has a projected human dose of 48 mg BID and a preclinical safety profile that supported advancement toward GLP toxicology studies.
