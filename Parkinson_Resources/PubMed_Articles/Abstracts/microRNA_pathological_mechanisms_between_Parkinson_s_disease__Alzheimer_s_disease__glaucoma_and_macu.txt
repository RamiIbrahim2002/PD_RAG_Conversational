Abstract:
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an essential role in regulating various functions of organisms such as gene transcription, signalling transduction and immune response. However, overproduction of ROS can lead to oxidative stress, which is related to various ageing diseases including eye and brain degenerative diseases. Ocular measurements have recently been suggested as potential sources of biomarkers for the early detection of brain neurodegenerative diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are useful biomarkers for various diseases including degenerative diseases. miRNAs play an important role in the oxidative stress mechanisms of ageing diseases. In this paper, the role of miRNAs related to oxidative stress mechanisms in four ageing diseases, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration was reviewed. The common miRNA biomarkers related to the four diseases were also discussed. The results show that these eye and brain ageing diseases share many common miRNA biomarkers. It indicates that the ocular condition may be a prognostic biomarker for PD or AD patients. When a patient's eye condition changes, this can be a warning of a change in PD or AD status.
