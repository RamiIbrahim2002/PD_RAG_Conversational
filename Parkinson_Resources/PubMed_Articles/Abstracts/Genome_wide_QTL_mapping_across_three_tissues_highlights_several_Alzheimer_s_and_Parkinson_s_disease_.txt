Title: Genome-wide QTL mapping across three tissues highlights several Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease loci potentially acting via DNA methylation.
PMID: 38196633

Abstract:
DNA methylation (DNAm) is an epigenetic mark with essential roles in disease development and predisposition. Here, we created genome-wide maps of methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) in three peripheral tissues and used Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess the potential causal relationships between DNAm and risk for two common neurodegenerative disorders, i.e. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; ~5.5M sites) and DNAm (~850K CpG sites) data were generated from whole blood (n=1,058), buccal (n=1,527) and saliva (n=837) specimens. We identified between 11 and 15 million genome-wide significant (p<10<sup>-14</sup>) SNP-CpG associations in each tissue. Combining these meQTL GWAS results with recent AD/PD GWAS summary statistics by MR strongly suggests that the previously described associations between <i>PSMC3</i>, <i>PICALM</i>, and <i>TSPAN14</i> and AD may be founded on differential DNAm in or near these genes. In addition, there is strong, albeit less unequivocal, support for causal links between DNAm at <i>PRDM7</i> in AD as well as at <i>KANSL1/MAPT</i> in AD and PD. Our study adds valuable insights on AD/PD pathogenesis by combining two high-resolution "omics" domains, and the meQTL data shared along with this publication will allow like-minded analyses in other diseases.
