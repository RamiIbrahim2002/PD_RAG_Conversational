Title: Harmaline toxicity on dorsal striatal neurons and its role in tremor.
PMID: 37838252

Abstract:
Harmaline is one of the β-carboline derivative compounds that is widely distributed in the food chain and human tissues. Harmine, a dehydrogenated form of harmaline, appeared to have a higher concentration in the brain, and appeared to be elevated in essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease. Exogenous harmaline exposure in high concentration has myriad consequences, including inducing tremor, and causing neurodegeneration of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Harmaline-induced tremor is an established animal model for human ET, but its underlying mechanism is still controversial. One hypothesis posits that the inferior olive-cerebellum pathway is involved, and CaV<sub>3.1</sub> T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel is a critical target of action. However, accumulating evidence indicates that tremor can be generated without disturbing T-type channels. This implies that additional neural circuits or molecular targets are involved. Using in vitro slice Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging and patch clamping, we demonstrated that harmaline reduced intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and suppressed depolarization-induced spiking activity of medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN), and this effect of harmaline can be partially attenuated by sulpiride (5 µM). In addition, the frequencies of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) on MSNs were also significantly attenuated. Furthermore, the induced tremor in C57BL/6 J mice by harmaline injections (i.p. 12.5-18 mg/kg) was also shown to be attenuated by sulpiride (20 mg/kg). This series of experiments suggests that the dorsal striatum is a site of harmaline toxic action and might contribute to tremor generation. The findings also provide evidence that D2 signaling might be a part of the mechanism underlying essential tremor.
