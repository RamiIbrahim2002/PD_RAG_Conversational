Abstract:
Selenium is an essential trace element for human health, playing a key role in regulating cellular oxidative stress, immune response, and inflammation. In recent years, the association between selenium and Parkinson's disease (PD) has aroused people's attention. The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between blood selenium concentrations and PD risk in a sample of U.S. adults. A cross-sectional study was conducted using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2020 and included 15,660 adults aged over 40 years old. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to analyze the association between blood selenium concentrations and PD prevalence. Additionally, the restricted cubic spline (RCS) model was applied to investigate the dose-response relationships between blood selenium and PD. The findings indicated a link between elevated blood selenium levels and a reduced occurrence of Parkinson's disease (PD). Notably, this association between blood selenium and PD exhibited a non-linear pattern, wherein the decline in PD risk was more pronounced at higher selenium concentrations than at lower levels. An inflection point emerged at approximately 2.4 Î¼mol/L, beyond which the rate of decline in risk significantly diminished with increasing selenium levels. A potential association between blood selenium concentrations and PD has been observed, with PD patients having lower blood selenium levels compared to non-PD patients. Higher levels of blood selenium may have a protective effect against PD. However, further prospective studies are needed to investigate the effect of blood selenium in PD patients and to determine causality.
