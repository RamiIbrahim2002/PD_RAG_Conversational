PMID: 38146566

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) reflects the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Besides the motor features, non-motor symptoms, such as constipation, are very common. There is accumulating evidence that neuroinflammation is associated with the PD pathological processes. Alterations of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites have been linked to the pathogenesis of PD. Previous research has shown that probiotic supplementation has beneficial effects on motor and non-motor symptoms and especially on constipation.
