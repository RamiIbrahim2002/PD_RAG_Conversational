PMID: 37684511

Abstract:
Safinamide is a recent antiparkinsonian drug that modulates both dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems with positive effects on motor and nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we aimed to describe the efficacy and safety of safinamide in the Italian PD patients in real-life conditions.
