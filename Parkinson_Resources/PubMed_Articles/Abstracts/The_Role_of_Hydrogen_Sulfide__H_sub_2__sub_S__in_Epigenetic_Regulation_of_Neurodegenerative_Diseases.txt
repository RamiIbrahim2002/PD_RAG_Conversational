Title: The Role of Hydrogen Sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) in Epigenetic Regulation of Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review.
PMID: 37628735

Abstract:
This review explores the emerging role of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) in modulating epigenetic mechanisms involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Accumulating evidence has begun to elucidate the multifaceted ways in which H<sub>2</sub>S influences the epigenetic landscape and, subsequently, the progression of various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease. H<sub>2</sub>S can modulate key components of the epigenetic machinery, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, impacting gene expression and cellular functions relevant to neuronal survival, inflammation, and synaptic plasticity. We synthesize recent research that positions H<sub>2</sub>S as an essential player within this intricate network, with the potential to open new therapeutic avenues for these currently incurable conditions. Despite significant progress, there remains a considerable gap in our understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms and the potential therapeutic implications of modulating H<sub>2</sub>S levels or its downstream targets. We conclude by identifying future directions for research aimed at exploiting the therapeutic potential of H<sub>2</sub>S in neurodegenerative diseases.
