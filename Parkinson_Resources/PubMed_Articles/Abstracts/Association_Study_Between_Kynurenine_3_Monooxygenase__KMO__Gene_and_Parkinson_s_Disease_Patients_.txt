Title: Association Study Between Kynurenine 3-Monooxygenase (KMO) Gene and Parkinson's Disease Patients.
PMID: 38040995

Abstract:
The influence of various risk factors such as aging, intricate cellular molecular processes, and lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, caffeine intake, and occupational factors has received increased focus in relation to the risk and development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Limited research has been conducted on the assessment of lifestyle impact on kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) gene in PD. A total of 164 subjects, including 82 PD cases and 82 healthy individuals, were recruited based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The severity of PD and clinical assessment were evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr (HY) scaling. Sanger sequencing was performed to analyse the KMO gene in the recruited subjects, and case-control studies were conducted. The UPDRS assessment revealed significant impairments in smell, tremors, walking, and posture instability in the late-onset PD cohorts. The HY scaling indicated a higher proportion of late-onset cohorts in stage 2. Moreover, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic groups showed significantly increased levels of 3-HK in late-onset PD. Gene analysis identified missense variants at position g.241593373 T > A (rs752312199) and intronic variants at positions g.241592623A > G (rs640718), g.241592800C > A (rs990388262), g.241592802A > C (rs1350160268), g.241592808 T > C (rs1478255936), and g.241592812G > T (rs948928931). The alterations in the KMO gene were found to influence the levels of kynurenic acid (KYNA) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK). Genomic analysis revealed a high prevalence of missense mutations in the late-onset PD groups, leading to a decline in 3-HK levels in patients. This leads to the reduction of the progression of disease in late-onset groups which shows that this mutation may lead to the protective effect on the PD subjects. This study suggests the use of KYNA and 3-HK as potential biomarkers in analysing the progression of disease. This study is limited by its small sample size. To overcome this limitation, a larger study involving in greater number of participants is needed to thoroughly investigate the KMO gene and KP metabolites, to enhance our understanding of Parkinson's disease progression, and to enhance diagnostic capabilities.
