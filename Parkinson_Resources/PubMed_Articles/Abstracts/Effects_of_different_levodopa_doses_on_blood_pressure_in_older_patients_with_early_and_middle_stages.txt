Title: Effects of different levodopa doses on blood pressure in older patients with early and middle stages of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37483692

Abstract:
Levodopa is the first-line treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, only a few studies have focused on the tolerance of this drug in older patients with PD in the early and middle stages. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of different levodopa doses on blood pressure (BP) in this subpopulation.
