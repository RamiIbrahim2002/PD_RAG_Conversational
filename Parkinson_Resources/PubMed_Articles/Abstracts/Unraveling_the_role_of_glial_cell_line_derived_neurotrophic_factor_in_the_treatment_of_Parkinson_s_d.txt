Title: Unraveling the role of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38082050

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative condition with its prevalence projected to 8.9 million individuals globally in the year 2019. Parkinson's disease affects both motor and certain non-motor functions of an individual. Numerous research has focused on the neuroprotective effect of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in Parkinson's disease. Discovered in 1993, GDNF is a neurotrophic factor identified from the glial cells which was found to have selective effects on promoting survival and regeneration of certain populations of neurons including the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway. Given this property, recent studies have focused on the exogenous administration of GDNF for relieving Parkinson's disease-related symptoms both at a pre-clinical and a clinical level. This review will focus on enumerating the molecular connection between Parkinson's disease and GDNF and shed light on all the available drug delivery approaches to facilitate the selective delivery of GDNF into the brain paving the way as a potential therapeutic candidate for Parkinson's disease in the future.
