Title: Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease: An Updated Overview Focusing on Emerging Pharmaceutical Treatment Approaches.
PMID: 37893474

Abstract:
Cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the commonest and most disabling non-motor manifestations during the course of the disease. The clinical spectrum of PD-related cognitive impairment includes subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and PD dementia (PDD). As the disease progresses, cognitive decline creates a significant burden for the family members and/or caregivers of patients with PD, and has a great impact on quality of life. Current pharmacological treatments have demonstrated partial efficacy and failed to halt disease progression, and novel, effective, and safe therapeutic strategies are required. Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence shows that several agents may provide beneficial effects on patients with PD and cognitive impairment, including ceftriaxone, ambroxol, intranasal insulin, nilotinib, atomoxetine, mevidalen, blarcamesine, prasinezumab, SYN120, ENT-01, NYX-458, GRF6021, fosgonimeton, INT-777, Neuropeptide S, silibinin, osmotin, cordycepin, huperzine A, fibroblast growth factor 21, Poloxamer 188, ginsenoside Rb1, thioredoxin-1, tangeretin, istradefylline and Eugenia uniflora. Potential underlying mechanisms include the inhibition of a-synuclein aggregation, the improvement of mitochondrial function, the regulation of synaptic plasticity, an impact on the gut-brain axis, the modulation of neuroinflammation and the upregulation of neurotrophic factors, as well as cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic and norepinephrine neurotransmission. In this updated overview, we aim to cover the clinical aspects of the spectrum of PD-related cognitive impairment and discuss recent evidence on emerging treatment approaches that are under investigation at a preclinical and clinical level. Finally, we aim to provide additional insights and propose new ideas for investigation that may be feasible and effective for the spectrum of PD-related cognitive impairment.
