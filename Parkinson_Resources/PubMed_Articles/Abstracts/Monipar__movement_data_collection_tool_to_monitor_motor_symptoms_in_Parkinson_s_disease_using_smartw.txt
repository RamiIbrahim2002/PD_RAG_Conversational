PMID: 38148984

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder commonly characterized by motor impairments. The development of mobile health (m-health) technologies, such as wearable and smart devices, presents an opportunity for the implementation of clinical tools that can support tasks such as early diagnosis and objective quantification of symptoms.
