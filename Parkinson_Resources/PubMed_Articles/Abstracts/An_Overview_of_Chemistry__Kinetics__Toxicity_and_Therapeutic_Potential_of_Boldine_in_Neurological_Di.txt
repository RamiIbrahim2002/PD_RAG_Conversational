PMID: 37462836

Abstract:
Boldine is an alkaloid obtained from the medicinal herb Peumus boldus (Mol.) (Chilean boldo tree; boldo) and belongs to the family Monimiaceae. It exhibits a wide range of pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, anticancer, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and anti-diabetic properties. There is a dearth of information regarding its pharmacokinetics and toxicity in addition to its potential pharmacological activity. Boldine belongs to the aporphine alkaloid class and possesses lipophilic properties which enable its efficient absorption and distribution throughout the body, including the central nervous system. It exhibits potent free radical scavenging activity, thereby reducing oxidative stress and preventing neuronal damage. Through a variety of neuroprotective mechanisms, including suppression of AChE and BuChE activity, blocking of connexin-43 hemichannels, pannexin 1 channel, reduction of NF-κβ mediated interleukin release, and glutamate excitotoxicity which successfully reduces neuronal damage. These results point to its probable application in reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, its effects on serotonergic, dopaminergic, opioid, and cholinergic receptors were further investigated in order to determine its applicability for neurobehavioral dysfunctions. The article investigates the pharmacokinetics of boldine and reveals that it has a low oral bioavailability and a short half-life, requiring regular dosage to maintain therapeutic levels. The review studies boldine's potential therapeutic uses and mode of action while summarizing its neuroprotective benefits.  Given the favorable results for boldine as a potential neurotherapeutic drug in laboratory animals, more research is required. However, in order to optimise its therapeutic potential, it must be more bioavailable with fewer detrimental side effects.
