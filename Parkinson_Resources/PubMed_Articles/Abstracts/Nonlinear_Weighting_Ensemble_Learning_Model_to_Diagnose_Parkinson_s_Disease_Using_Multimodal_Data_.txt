Title: Nonlinear Weighting Ensemble Learning Model to Diagnose Parkinson's Disease Using Multimodal Data.
PMID: 37470777

Abstract:
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder among adults. Although its triggers are still not clear, they may be due to a combination of different types of biomarkers measured through medical imaging, metabolomics, proteomics or genetics, among others. In this context, we have proposed a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system that combines structural and functional imaging data from subjects in Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset by means of an Ensemble Learning methodology trained to identify and penalize input sources with low classification rates and/ or high-variability. This proposal improves results published in recent years and provides an accurate solution not only from the point of view of image preprocessing (including a comparison between different intensity preservation techniques), but also in terms of dimensionality reduction methods (Isomap). In addition, we have also introduced a bagging classification schema for scenarios with unbalanced data. As shown by our results, the CAD proposal is able to detect PD with [Formula: see text] of balanced accuracy, and opens up the possibility of combining any number of input data sources relevant for PD.
