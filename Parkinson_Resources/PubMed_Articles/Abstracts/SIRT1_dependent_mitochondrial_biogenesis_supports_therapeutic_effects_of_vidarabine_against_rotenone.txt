Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world, which is distinguished by the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of intraneuronal. Numerous studies showed that the damage and dysfunction of mitochondria may play key roles in DA neuronal loss. Thus, it is necessary to seek therapeutic measures for PD targeting mitochondrial function and biogenesis. In this study, through screening the purchased compound library, we found that marine derived vidarabine had significant neuroprotective effects against rotenone (ROT) induced SH-SY5Y cell injury. Further studies indicated that vidarabine pretreatment significantly protected ROT-treated SH-SY5Y cells from toxicity by preserving mitochondrial morphology, improving mitochondrial function, and reducing cell apoptosis. Vidarabine also reduced the oxidative stress and increased the expression levels of PGC-1Î±, NRF1, and TFAM proteins, which was accompanied by the increased mitochondrial biogenesis. However, the neuroprotective effects of vidarabine were counteracted in the presence of SIRT1-specific inhibitor Ex-527. Besides, vidarabine treatment attenuated the weight loss, alleviated the motor deficits and inhibited the neuronal injury in the MPTP induced mouse model. Thus, vidarabine may exert neuroprotective effects via a mechanism involving specific connections between the SIRT1-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis and its antioxidant capacity, suggesting that vidarabine has potential to be developed into a novel therapeutic agent for PD.
