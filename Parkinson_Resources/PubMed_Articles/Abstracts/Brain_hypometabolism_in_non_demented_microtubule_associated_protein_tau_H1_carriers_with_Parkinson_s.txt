Title: Brain hypometabolism in non-demented microtubule-associated protein tau H1 carriers with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37726927

Abstract:
The microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) H1 homozygosity (H1/H1 haplotype) is a genetic risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). MAPT H1 homozygosity has been associated with conversion to PD; however, results are conflicting since some studies did not find a strong influence. Cortical hypometabolism is associated with cognitive impairment in PD. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the metabolic pattern in nondemented PD patients MAPT H1/H1 carriers in comparison with MAPT H1/H2 haplotype. In addition, we evaluated domain-specific cognitive differences according to MAPT haplotype.
