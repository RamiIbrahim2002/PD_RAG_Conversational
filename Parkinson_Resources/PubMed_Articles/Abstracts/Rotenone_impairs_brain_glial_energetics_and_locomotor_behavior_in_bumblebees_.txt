Title: Rotenone impairs brain glial energetics and locomotor behavior in bumblebees.
PMID: 37865240

Abstract:
Bumblebees are essential pollinators of both wildflowers and crops and face multiple anthropogenic stressors, particularly the utilization of pesticides. Rotenone is an extensively applied neurotoxic pesticide that possesses insecticidal activities against a wide range of pests. However, whether environmentally realistic exposure levels of rotenone can damage neurons in bumblebee brains is still uncertain. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we revealed that rotenone induced cell-specific responses in bumblebee brains, emphasizing the disruption of energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in glial cells. Correspondingly, the gene regulatory network associated with neurotransmission was also suppressed. Notably, rotenone could specially reduce the number of dopaminergic neurons, impairing bumblebee's ability to fly and crawl. We also found impaired intestinal motility in rotenone-treated bumblebees. Finally, we demonstrated that many differentially expressed genes in our snRNA-seq data overlapped with rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease risk genes, especially in glial cells. Although rotenone is widely used owing to its hypotoxicity, we found that environmentally realistic exposure levels of rotenone induced disturbed glial energetics and locomotor dysfunction in bumblebees, which may lead to an indirect decline in this essential pollinator.
