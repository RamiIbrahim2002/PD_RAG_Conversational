Title: Regulatory effect of bacterial melanin on the isoforms of new superoxide-producing associates from rat tissues in rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38124101

Abstract:
According to recent research, selective neuronal vulnerability in Parkinson's disease (PD) results from several phenotypic traits, including calcium-dependent, feed-forward control of mitochondrial respiration leading to elevated reactive oxygen species and cytosolic calcium concentration, an extensive axonal arbor, and a reactive neurotransmitter. Therefore, antioxidant therapy is a promising direction in the treatment of PD. In vitro studies have indicated the survival-promoting activity of bacterial melanin (BM) on midbrain dopaminergic neuron cultures. It has been established that BM has a number of protective and anti-inflammatory properties, so there is a high probability of a protective effect of BM in the early stages of PD. In this study, PD was induced through the unilateral intracerebral administration of rotenone followed by bacterial melanin. Tissues (brain, lungs, and small intestine) from the observed groups underwent isolation and purification to extract isoforms of new thermostable superoxide (О<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>)-producing associates between NADPH-containing lipoprotein (NLP) and NADPH oxidase-Nox (NLP-Nox). The optical absorption spectral characteristics, specific amounts, stationary concentration of the produced О<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, and the content of NADPH in the observed associates were determined. The optical absorption spectra of the NLP-Nox isoforms in the visible and UV regions in the experimental groups did not differ from those of the control group. However, compared with the control group, the specific content of the total fractions of NLP-Nox isoforms associated with PD groups was higher, especially in the small intestine. These findings suggest that the described changes may represent a novel mechanism for rotenone-induced PD. Furthermore, bacterial melanin demonstrated antioxidant properties and regulated membrane formation in the brain, lung, and small intestine. This regulation occurred by inhibiting the release of new membrane-bound formations (NLP-Nox associates) from these membranes while simultaneously regulating the steady-state concentration of the formed О<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>.
