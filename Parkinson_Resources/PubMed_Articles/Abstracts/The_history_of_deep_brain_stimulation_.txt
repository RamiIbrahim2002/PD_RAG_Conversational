Title: The history of deep brain stimulation.
PMID: 38161106

Abstract:
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is an established and effective treatment for several movement disorders (tremor, Parkinson's disease, and dystonia), and is under investigation in numerous other neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the origins and development of this neurofunctional technique are not always well understood and recognized. In this mini-review, we review the history of DBS, highlighting important milestones and the most remarkable protagonists (neurosurgeons, neurologists, and neurophysiologists) who pioneered and fostered this therapy throughout the 20th and early 21st century. Alongside DBS historical markers, we also briefly discuss newer developments in the field, and the future challenges which accompany such progress.
