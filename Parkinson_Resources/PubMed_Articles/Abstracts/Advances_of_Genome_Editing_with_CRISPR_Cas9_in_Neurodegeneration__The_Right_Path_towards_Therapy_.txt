PMID: 38137554

Abstract:
The rate of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) is rising rapidly as the world's population ages. Conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia are becoming more prevalent and are now the fourth leading cause of death, following heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Although modern diagnostic techniques for detecting NDDs are varied, scientists are continuously seeking new and improved methods to enable early and precise detection. In addition to that, the present treatment options are limited to symptomatic therapy, which is effective in reducing the progression of neurodegeneration but lacks the ability to target the root cause-progressive loss of neuronal functioning. As a result, medical researchers continue to explore new treatments for these conditions. Here, we present a comprehensive summary of the key features of NDDs and an overview of the underlying mechanisms of neuroimmune dysfunction. Additionally, we dive into the cutting-edge treatment options that gene therapy provides in the quest to treat these disorders.
