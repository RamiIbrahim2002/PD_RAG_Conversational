Abstract:
Alpha-synuclein (SNCA) accumulation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Determining and interfering with the mechanisms that control SNCA expression is one approach to limiting disease progression. Currently, most of our understanding of SNCA regulation is protein-based. Post-transcriptional mechanisms directly regulating <i>SNCA</i> mRNA expression via its 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) were investigated here. Mass spectrometry of proteins pulled down from murine brain lysates using a biotinylated <i>SNCA</i> 3'UTR revealed multiple RNA-binding proteins, of which HNRNPD/AUF1 was chosen for further analysis. AUF1 bound both proximal and distal regions of the <i>SNCA</i> 3'UTR, but not the 5'UTR or CDS. In the nucleus, AUF1 attenuated <i>SNCA</i> pre-mRNA maturation and was indispensable for the export of <i>SNCA</i> transcripts. AUF1 destabilized <i>SNCA</i> transcripts in the cytosol, primarily those with shorter 3'UTRs, independently of microRNAs by recruiting the CNOT1-CNOT7 deadenylase complex to trim the polyA tail. Furthermore, AUF1 inhibited <i>SNCA</i> mRNA binding to ribosomes. These data identify AUF1 as a multi-tasking protein regulating maturation, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, stability and translation of <i>SNCA</i> transcripts.
