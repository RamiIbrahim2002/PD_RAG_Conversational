PMID: 37419226

Abstract:
Acanthopanax senticosus (Rupr.et.Maxim.)Harms(AS) is an extract of Eleutherococcus senticocus Maxim(Rupr.et.Maxim.). In modern medical interpretation, Acanthopanax senticosus can be used to treat Parkinson's disease, and a large number of modern pharmacological and clinical studies also support this application. Our study demonstrated that AS extracts can increase the activity of various antioxidant enzymes and improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in mice.
