Title: Primary lateral sclerosis plus parkinsonism: a case report.
PMID: 37644413

Abstract:
The standard of diagnosing primary lateral sclerosis, the Pringle criteria, requires three years of purely upper motor neuron symptom presentation before confirming diagnosis. This classic standard has been questioned on occasion due to its restrictive range of both time period and symptomatic exhibition.
