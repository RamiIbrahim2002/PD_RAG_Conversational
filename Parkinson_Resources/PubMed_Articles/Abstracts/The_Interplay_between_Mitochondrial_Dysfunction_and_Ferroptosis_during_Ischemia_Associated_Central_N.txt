Title: The Interplay between Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Ferroptosis during Ischemia-Associated Central Nervous System Diseases.
PMID: 37891735

Abstract:
Cerebral ischemia, a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide, triggers a cascade of molecular and cellular pathologies linked to several central nervous system (CNS) disorders. These disorders primarily encompass ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, and other CNS conditions. Despite substantial progress in understanding and treating the underlying pathological processes in various neurological diseases, there is still a notable absence of effective therapeutic approaches aimed specifically at mitigating the damage caused by these illnesses. Remarkably, ischemia causes severe damage to cells in ischemia-associated CNS diseases. Cerebral ischemia initiates oxygen and glucose deprivation, which subsequently promotes mitochondrial dysfunction, including mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, mitophagy dysfunction, and excessive mitochondrial fission, triggering various forms of cell death such as autophagy, apoptosis, as well as ferroptosis. Ferroptosis, a novel type of regulated cell death (RCD), is characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis both play critical roles in the pathogenic progression of ischemia-associated CNS diseases. In recent years, growing evidence has indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction interplays with ferroptosis to aggravate cerebral ischemia injury. However, the potential connections between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in cerebral ischemia have not yet been clarified. Thus, we analyzed the underlying mechanism between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in ischemia-associated CNS diseases. We also discovered that GSH depletion and GPX4 inactivation cause lipoxygenase activation and calcium influx following cerebral ischemia injury, resulting in MPTP opening and mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, dysfunction in mitochondrial electron transport and an imbalanced fusion-to-fission ratio can lead to the accumulation of ROS and iron overload, which further contribute to the occurrence of ferroptosis. This creates a vicious cycle that continuously worsens cerebral ischemia injury. In this study, our focus is on exploring the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis, which may offer new insights into potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of ischemia-associated CNS diseases.
