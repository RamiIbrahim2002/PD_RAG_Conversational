Title: Neurovascular coupling dysfunction of visual network organization in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37838006

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) has been showed perfusion and neural activity alterations in specific regions, such as the motor and visual networks; however, the clinical significance of coupling changes is still unknown. To identify how neurovascular coupling changes during the pathophysiology of PD, patients and healthy controls underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural activity organization of segregation and integration using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity strength (FCS), and measure vascular responses using cerebral blood flow (CBF). Neurovascular coupling was calculated as the global CBF-ALFF and CBF-FCS coupling and the regional CBF/ALFF and CBF/FCS ratio. Correlations and dynamic causal modeling was then used to evaluate relationships with disease-alterations to clinical variables and information flow. Neurovascular coupling was impaired in PD with decreased global CBF-ALFF and CBF-FCS coupling, as well as decreased CBF/ALFF in the parieto-occipital cortex (dorsal visual stream) and CBF/FCS in the temporo-occipital cortex (ventral visual stream); these decouplings were associated with motor and non-motor impairments. The distinctive patterns of neurovascular coupling alterations within the dorsal and ventral visual streams of the visual system could potentially provide additional understanding into the pathophysiological mechanisms of PD.
