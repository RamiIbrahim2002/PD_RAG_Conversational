Title: Image-encoded biological and non-biological variables may be used as shortcuts in deep learning models trained on multisite neuroimaging data.
PMID: 37669158

Abstract:
This work investigates if deep learning (DL) models can classify originating site locations directly from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with and without correction for intensity differences.
