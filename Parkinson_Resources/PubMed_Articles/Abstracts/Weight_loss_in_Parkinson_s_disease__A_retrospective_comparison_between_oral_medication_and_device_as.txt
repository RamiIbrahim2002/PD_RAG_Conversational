PMID: 38194744

Abstract:
Weight loss (WL) is the most common symptom among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and has been reported to start several years before the diagnosis of PD. The relationship between WL and PD treatment is complex. This study aimed to characterize the impact of PD treatment on WL and find clues to establish the administration of nutrition for patients with PD.
