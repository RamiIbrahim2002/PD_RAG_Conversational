Title: Progression of brain cholinergic dysfunction in patients with isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.
PMID: 37847229

Abstract:
Reduced cortical acetylcholinesterase activity, as measured by <sup>11</sup> C-donepezil positron emission tomography (PET), has been reported in patients with isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). However, its progression and clinical implications have not been fully investigated. Here, we explored the relationship between longitudinal changes in brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cognitive function in iRBD.
