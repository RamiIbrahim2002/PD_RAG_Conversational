Title: Impact of 12 Weeks of Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> Administration in Parkinson's Patients with Deep Brain Stimulation on Kynurenine Pathway and Inflammatory Status.
PMID: 37686871

Abstract:
The current study aimed to investigate whether a 12-week Body Mass Index (BMI)-based (the higher the BMI, the higher the dosage) vitamin D<sub>3</sub> administration may affect both the kynurenine pathway (KP) and the inflammatory state in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) and may be useful for developing novel therapeutic targets against PD. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: supplemented with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (VitD, n = 15) and treated with vegetable oil (PL, n = 21). Administration lasted for 12 weeks. The isotope dilution method by LC-MS/MS was applied to measure KP and vitamin D metabolites. Serum concentrations of cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α were measured using ELISA kits. After administration, the serum concentration of TNF-α decreased in PD patients with DBS. Moreover, in KP: 3-hydroksykynurenine (3-HK) was increased in the PL group, picolinic acid was decreased in the PL group, and kynurenic acid tended to be higher after administration. Furthermore, a negative correlation between 3-HK and 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> and 24,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> was noticed. Our preliminary results provide further evidence regarding a key link between the KP substances, inflammation status, and metabolites of vitamin D in PD patients with DBS. These findings may reflect the neuroprotective abilities of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in PD patients with DBS.
