Title: No Correlation between Plasma GPNMB Levels and Multiple System Atrophy in Chinese Cohorts.
PMID: 37497669

Abstract:
Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) has been demonstrated to mediate pathogenicity in Parkinson's disease (PD) through interactions with Î±-synuclein, and plasma GPNMB tended to be a novel biomarker for PD.
