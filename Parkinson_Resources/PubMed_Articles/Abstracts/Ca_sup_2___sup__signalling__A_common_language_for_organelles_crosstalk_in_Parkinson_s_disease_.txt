Title: Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling: A common language for organelles crosstalk in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37597300

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms. Familial PD is linked with genetic mutations in genes whose products are either associated with mitochondrial function or endo-lysosomal pathways. Of note, mitochondria are essential to sustain high energy demanding synaptic activity of neurons and alterations in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>Â signaling have been proposed as causal events for neurodegenerative process, although the mechanisms responsible for the selective loss of specific neuronal populations in the different neurodegenerative diseases is still not clear. Here, we specifically discuss the importance of a correct mitochondrial communication with the other organelles occurring at regions where their membranes become in close contact. We discuss the nature and the role of contact sites that mitochondria establish with ER, lysosomes, and peroxisomes, and how PD related proteins participate in the regulation/dysregulation of the tethering complexes. Unravelling molecular details of mitochondria tethering could contribute to identify specific therapeutic targets and develop new strategies to counteract the progression of the disease.
