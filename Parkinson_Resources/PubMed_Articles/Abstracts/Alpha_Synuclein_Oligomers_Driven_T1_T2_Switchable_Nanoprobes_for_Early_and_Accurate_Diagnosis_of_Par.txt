PMID: 38149464

Abstract:
The alpha-synuclein (α-syn) oligomers hold a central role in the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Achieving accurate detection of α-syn oligomers in vivo presents a promising avenue for early and accurate diagnosis of PD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with non-invasion and exceptional tissue penetration, offers a potent tool for visualizing α-syn oligomers in vivo. Nonetheless, ensuring diagnostic specificity remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a novel MRI probe (ASOSN) is introduced, which encompasses highly sensitive antiferromagnetic nanoparticles functionalized with single-chain fragment variable antibodies, endowing it with the capacity for discerning recognition and binding to α-syn oligomers and triggering a switchable T1-T2 MRI signal. Significantly, ASOSN possesses the unique capability to accurately discriminate α-syn oligomers from neuroinflammation in vivo. Moreover, ASOSN facilitates the non-invasive and precise visualizing of endogenous α-syn oligomers in living systems. This innovative design heralds the development of a non-invasive visualization strategy for α-syn oligomers, marking a pivotal advancement for early and accurate diagnosis of PD.
