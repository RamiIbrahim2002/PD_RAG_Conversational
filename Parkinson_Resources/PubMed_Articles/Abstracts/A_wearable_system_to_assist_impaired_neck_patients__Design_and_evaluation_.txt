Title: A wearable system to assist impaired-neck patients: Design and evaluation.
PMID: 38031465

Abstract:
Patients with neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral palsy, often face challenges due to head-neck immobility. The conventional treatment approach involves using a neck collar to maintain an upright head position, but this can be cumbersome and restricts head-neck movements over prolonged periods. This study introduces a wearable robot capable of providing three anatomical head motions for training and assistance. The primary contributions of this research include the design of an optimized structure and the incorporation of human-robot interaction. Based on human head motion data, our primary focus centered on developing a robot capable of accommodating a significant range of neutral head movements. To ensure safety, impedance control was employed to facilitate human-robot interaction. A human study was conducted involving 10 healthy subjects who participated in an experiment to assess the robot's assistance capabilities. Passive and active modes were used to evaluate the robot's effectiveness, taking into account head-neck movement error and muscle activity levels. Surface electromyography signals (sEMG) were collected from the splenius capitis muscles during the experiment. The results demonstrated that the robot covered nearly 85% of the overall range of head rotations. Importantly, using the robot during rehabilitation led to reduced muscle activation, highlighting its potential for assisting individuals with post-stroke movement impairments.
