PMID: 37659233

Abstract:
The analysis of low abundance phosphopeptides in organisms and specific capture exosomes are crucial for unraveling the pathogenesis of diseases. For this reason, titanium-zirconium ions and highly biocompatible dopamine and polyimide tubes (PITs) were introduced, and a novel carbon-based material with titanium and zirconium ions etched on hollow mesoporous carbon tubes (HMCT), denoted as G@C@Ti-Zr-HMCT, comes into being after high-temperature calcination. Attributing to the tightly bound titanium and zirconium ions to HMCT and the high carbon content of the polydopamine carbonaceous layer, G@C@Ti-Zr-HMCT displays satisfactory capability of enriching phosphopeptides with satisfactory detection limit (0.2 fmol), extraordinary selectivity (1:2000), and good loading capacity (100 μg/mg). In addition, 25 phosphopeptides related to 25 phosphoproteins from the serum of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and 30 phosphopeptides attributed to 26 phosphoproteins from the serum of healthy individuals were enriched by G@C@Ti-Zr-HMCT, respectively. In addition, bioinformatics analysis of the above results revealed that PD were associated with serine, threonine, and leucine of high frequency, blood coagulation in BP, Golgi apparatus and mitochondrial outer membrane in CC, and heparin binding in MF. Moreover, the phospholipid bilayer of exosomes and metallic titanium and zirconium ions interact to produce the following results: this highly biocompatible carbon-based material was successfully applied to capture exosomes, which offers a promising platform for isolating exosomes. To sum up, these delightful results confirmed without doubt that G@C@Ti-Zr-HMCT has enjoyed a splendiferous future in the specific capture of phosphopeptides and exosomes isolation.
