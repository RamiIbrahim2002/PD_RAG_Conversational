Title: The Golgi complex of dopaminergic enteric neurons is fragmented in a hemiparkinsonian rat model.
PMID: 37855309

Abstract:
Since gastrointestinal disorders are early consequences of Parkinson's disease (PD), this disease is clearly not restricted to the central nervous system (CNS), but also significantly affects the enteric nervous system (ENS). Large aggregates of the protein Î±-synuclein forming Lewy bodies, the prototypical cytopathological marker of this disease, have been observed in enteric nervous plexuses. However, their value in early prognosis is controversial. The Golgi complex (GC) of nigral neurons appears fragmented in Parkinson's disease, a characteristic common in most neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the distribution and levels of regulatory proteins such as Rabs and SNAREs are altered, suggesting that PD is a membrane traffic-related pathology. Whether the GC of enteric dopaminergic neurons is affected by the disease has not yet been analyzed. In the present study, dopaminergic neurons in colon nervous plexuses behave as nigral neurons in a hemiparkinsonian rat model based on the injection of the toxin 6-OHDA. Their GCs are fragmented, and some regulatory proteins' distribution and expression levels are altered. The putative mechanisms of the transmission of the neurotoxin to the ENS are discussed. Our results support the possibility that GC structure and the level of some proteins, especially syntaxin 5, could be helpful as early indicators of the disease. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: The Golgi complexes of enteric dopaminergic neurons appear fragmented in a Parkinson's disease rat model. Our results support the hypothesis that the Golgi complex structure and levels of Rab1 and syntaxin 5 could be helpful as early indicators of the disease.
