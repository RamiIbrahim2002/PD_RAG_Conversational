Title: USP7 attenuates endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptotic cell death through deubiquitination and stabilization of FBXO7.
PMID: 37874827

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease (NDD) characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Similar to other NDDs, the buildup of toxic protein aggregates in PD leads to progressive neuronal loss, culminating in neurodegeneration. Accumulating evidence indicates that alterations in subcellular organelles, particularly the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), are critically involved in pathological neurodegenerative events in NDDs, including PD. Mutations in the F-box only protein 7 (FBXO7 or PARK15) gene have been found to cause early onset autosomal recessive familiar PD. FBXO7 functions as an adaptor protein in the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which promotes substrate ubiquitination. Although FBXO7 is involved in the ubiquitination of various target proteins, little is known about the upstream regulatory mechanism of FBXO7 and/or its modulator(s). Ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates the balance between protein synthesis and degradation by removing ubiquitin from target substrates. The role of USP7 in various types of cancer is well-established; however, its role in NDDs has not been elucidated to date. In this study, we identified that USP7 acts as a novel regulator of FBXO7, positively regulating the stability of FBXO7 through Lys48-linked deubiquitination. Moreover, USP7 was found to mitigate ER stress-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis by preventing the proteasomal degradation of FBXO7. Taken together, our study suggests that the functional relationship between FBXO7 and USP7 may play a crucial role in ER stress-induced apoptosis and the pathogenesis of PD.
