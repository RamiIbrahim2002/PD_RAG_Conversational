PMID: 37964054

Abstract:
This study aimed to determine the effect of spiritual orientations and religious attitudes on coping with the difficulties of family caregivers of people with Parkinson's disease. This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted with 113 family caregivers of people with Parkinson's disease who came to be examined in the Neurology outpatient clinic of a Training and Research Hospital in Türkiye between July and September 2023. Data were obtained using a Patient and Family Caregivers Information Form, the Spiritual Orientation Scale (SOS), and the Ok-Religious Attitude Scale (Islam) (ORASI). The mean age of the family caregivers was 55.6 ± 14.2, the SOS total mean score was 89.1 ± 16.2, and the ORASI total score mean was 34.4 ± 4.0. It was determined that 61.1% of the caregivers experienced changes psychologically, 57.5% in their social life, 58.4% in their home life, and 57.5% in their family relationships. A statistically significant relationship was detected between the ORASI of family caregivers who experienced financial and physical distress and the SOS of those who experienced physical and psychological distress (p < 0.05). It was determined that family caregivers of people with Parkinson's disease were affected in many areas physically, socially, and psychologically and that their spiritual orientation and religious attitudes were effective in coping with the problems experienced. Training and support programs are recommended for nurses to develop positive religious attitudes, increase their spiritual orientation and reduce the care burden, taking into account the beliefs and values of family caregivers.
