Title: Melanin-The Ã‰minence Grise of Melanoma and Parkinson's Disease Development.
PMID: 38067245

Abstract:
A common feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and melanoma is their starting points being based on cells capable of converting tyrosine into melanin. Melanocytes produce two types of melanin: eumelanin and pheomelanin. These dyes are designed to protect epidermal cells from the harmful effects of UV radiation. Neurones of the substantia nigra, which degenerate during PD, produce neuromelanin, the physiological role of which is not fully explained. This article discusses the potential role of melanins in the pathogenesis of both diseases. Melanins, due to their ability to accumulate toxic substances, may become their sources over time. The use of glutathione for the synthesis of pheomelanins and neuromelanins may reduce the antioxidant capacity of cells, leading to an excessive synthesis of free radicals. This study also tested the hypothesis that certain drugs used in the treatment of PD (L-DOPA, MAO-B and COMT inhibitors, and amantadine), aimed at increasing dopamine concentration, could potentially contribute to the development of melanoma. The role and properties of melanins should continue to be researched. Whether excessive melanin synthesis or its accumulation in the extracellular space may be factors initiating the development of diseases remains an open question.
