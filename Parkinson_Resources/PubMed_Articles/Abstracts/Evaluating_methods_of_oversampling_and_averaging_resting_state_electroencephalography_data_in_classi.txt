PMID: 38082678

Abstract:
Collecting resting-state electroencephalography (RSEEG) data is time-consuming and data sets are therefore often small. Because many machine learning (ML) algorithms work better with ample data, researchers looking to use RSEEG and ML to develop diagnostic models have used oversampling methods that may seem to contradict averaging methods used in conventional electroencephalography (EEG) research to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Using eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) recordings from 3 different research groups, we investigated the effect of different averaging and oversampling methods on classification metrics when classifying people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and controls. Both EC and EO recordings were used due to differences found between these methods. Our results indicated that grouping 58 electrodes into regions-of-interest (ROI) based on anatomical location is preferable to using single electrodes. Furthermore, although recording EO data led to slightly better classification, the number of data points for each participant was reduced and recordings for three participants entirely lost during pre-processing due to a higher level of artefacts than in the EC data.Clinical relevance- RSEEG is a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognostication of PD, but for RSEEG to have clinical relevance, it is necessary to establish which averaging and oversampling of data most reliably segregates the classes for people with PD and controls. We found that using of ROIs and EC data performed the best, as EO data was often contaminated with artefacts.
