Abstract:
A proteostasis network represents a sophisticated cellular system that controls the whole process which leads to properly folded functional proteins. The imbalance of proteostasis determines a quantitative increase in misfolded proteins prone to aggregation and elicits the onset of different diseases. Among these, Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive brain disorder characterized by motor and non-motor signs. In PD pathogenesis, alpha-Synuclein (α-Syn) loses its native structure, triggering a polymerization cascade that leads to the formation of toxic inclusions, the PD hallmark. Because molecular chaperones represent a "cellular arsenal" to counteract protein misfolding and aggregation, the modulation of their expression represents a compelling PD therapeutic strategy. This review will discuss evidence concerning the effects of natural and synthetic small molecules in counteracting α-Syn aggregation process and related toxicity, in different in vitro and in vivo PD models. Firstly, the role of small molecules that modulate the function(s) of chaperones will be highlighted. Then, attention will be paid to small molecules that interfere with different steps of the protein-aggregation process. This overview would stimulate in-depth research on already-known small molecules or the development of new ones, with the aim of developing drugs that are able to modify the progression of the disease.
