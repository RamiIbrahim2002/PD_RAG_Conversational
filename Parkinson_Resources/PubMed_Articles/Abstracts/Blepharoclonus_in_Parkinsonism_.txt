Title: Blepharoclonus in Parkinsonism.
PMID: 38156119

Abstract:
In clinical practice, we have observed that patients with Parkinson disease (PD) often have blepharoclonus, but its prevalence is not well described in the literature. Understanding the relative frequencies of blepharoclonus in PD and atypical parkinsonian syndromes may shed light on the diagnostic utility of this clinical sign. We aimed to assess (1) the frequency of blepharoclonus in patients with PD in a single-center cohort; (2) the association of blepharoclonus with disease stage, tremor severity, and non-motor symptoms; and (3) the frequency of blepharoclonus in synucleinopathy vs non-synucleinopathy-associated parkinsonism.
