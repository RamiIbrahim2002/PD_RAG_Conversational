Title: Psychobiotics for Mitigation of Neuro-Degenerative Diseases: Recent Advancements.
PMID: 37715243

Abstract:
Ageing is inevitable and poses a universal challenge for all living organisms, including humans. The human body experiences rapid cell division and metabolism until approximately 25 years of age, after which the accumulation of metabolic by-products and cellular damage leads to age-related diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases are of concern due to their irreversible nature, lack of effective treatment, and impact on society and the economy. Researchers are interested in finding drugs that can effectively alleviate ageing and age-related diseases without side-effects. Psychobiotics are a novel class of probiotic organisms and prebiotic interventions that confer mental health benefits to the host when taken appropriately. Psychobiotic strains affect functions related to the central nervous system (CNS) and behaviors mediated by the Gut-Brain-Axis (GBA) through various pathways. There is an increasing interest in researchers of these microbial-based psychopharmaceuticals. Psychobiotics have been reported to reduce neuronal ageing, inflammation, oxidative stress, and cortisol levels; increase synaptic plasticity and levels of neurotransmitters and antioxidants. The present review focuses on the manifestation of elderly neurodegenerative and mental disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and depression, and the current status of their potential alleviation through psychobiotic interventions, highlighting their possible mechanisms of action.
