Title: Drug-Resistant Parkinson's Disease in a Patient With Hereditary Hemochromatosis: A Case Report.
PMID: 37790065

Abstract:
A 55-year-old male, with a strong family history of hereditary hemochromatosis, presented with progressively worsening right-sided tremor and Parkinsonian symptoms. He was diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis based on genetic testing and started undergoing regular phlebotomies to reduce his blood iron levels. Despite extensive trials of different pharmaceutical therapies, including levodopa-carbidopa, his Parkinsonian symptoms were not relieved and continued to worsen. This report serves to highlight the importance of early disease identification and intervention in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis to prevent the development of neurological sequelae, as well as a need for further research into effective therapies in such patients.
