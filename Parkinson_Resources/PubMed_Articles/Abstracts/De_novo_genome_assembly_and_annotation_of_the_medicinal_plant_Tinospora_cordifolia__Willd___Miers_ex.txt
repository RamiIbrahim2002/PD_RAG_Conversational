Abstract:
Indian natural climbing shrub Tinospora cordifolia, often known as "Guduchi" and "Amrita," is a highly esteemed medicinal plant in the Indian system of medicine (ISM). It is a member of the Menispermaceae family which consists of a rich source of protein, micronutrients, and rich source of bioactive components which are used in treating various systemic diseases. The current study was designed to know the biological characterization of the plant genome and biosynthesis of plant metabolites essential for its medicinal applications. Tinospora cordifolia's complete genome was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing technology. The draft genome was assembled through a de novo method. An integrative genome annotation approach was used to perform functional gene prediction. The pathway analysis was carried out using the KEGG database. The total genome size obtained after genome assembly was 894 Mb with an N50 of 9148 bp. The integrative annotation approach resulted in 35,111 protein-coding genes. In addition, genes responsible for the synthesis of syringin, a secondary metabolite found in plants, were identified. In comparison to the standard drug (dopamine, rasagiline, and selegiline), syringin's molecular docking exhibited a greater binding affinity from the range of - 4.3 to - 6.6 kcal/mol for all the targets of Parkinson's disease and for Alzheimer's targets; it has shown the maximum potency from the range of - 6.5 to - 7.4 kcal/mol with respect to the standard drug (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine). This study provides the genomic information of Tinospora cordifolia which is helpful in understanding genomic insights and metabolic pathways connected to the corresponding plant genome and predicts the possible useful effect for the molecular characterization of therapeutic drugs.
