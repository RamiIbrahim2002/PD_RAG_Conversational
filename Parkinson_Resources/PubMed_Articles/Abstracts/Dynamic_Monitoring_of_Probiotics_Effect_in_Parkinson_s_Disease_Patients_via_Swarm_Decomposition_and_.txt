Title: Dynamic Monitoring of Probiotics Effect in Parkinson's Disease Patients via Swarm Decomposition and Bispectral Analysis of Electrogastrograms.
PMID: 38082901

Abstract:
People with Parkinson's Disease (PwP) experience a significant deterioration of their daily life quality due to non-motor symptoms, with gastrointestinal dysfunctions manifesting as a vanguard of the latter. Electrogastrography (EGG) is a noninvasive diagnostic tool that can potentially provide biomarkers for the monitoring of dynamic gastric alterations that are related to daily lifestyle and treatment regimens. In this work, a robust analysis of EGG dynamics is introduced to evaluate the effect of probiotic treatment on PwP. The proposed framework, namely biSEGG, introduces a Swarm Decomposition-based enhancement of the EGG, combined with Bispectral feature engineering to model the underlying Quadratic Phase Coupling interactions between the gastric activity oscillatory components of EGG. The biSEGG features are benchmarked against the conventional Power Spectrum-based ones and evaluated through machine learning classifiers. The experimental results, when biSEGG was applied on data epochs from 11 PwP (probiotic vs placebo, AUROC: 0.67, Sensitivity/Specificity: 75/58%), indicate the superiority of biSEGG over Power Spectrum-based approaches and justify the efficiency of biSEGG in capturing and explaining intervention- and meal consumption-related alterations of the gastric activity in PwP.Clinical relevance- biSEGG holds potential for dynamic monitoring of gastrointestinal dysfunction and health status of PwP across diverse daily life scenarios.
