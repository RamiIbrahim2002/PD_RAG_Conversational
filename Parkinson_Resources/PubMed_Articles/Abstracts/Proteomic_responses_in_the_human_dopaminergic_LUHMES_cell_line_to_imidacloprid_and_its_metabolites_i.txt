Abstract:
Neonicotinoids (neonics) are amongst the most commonly used class of pesticides globally. In the United States, imidacloprid (IMI) is extensively used for agriculture and in other common applications such as house-hold pest control. Regular exposure to IMI, and several of its known metabolites including IMI-olefin and desnitro-imidacloprid (DN-IMI), has been shown to be harmful to many organisms including mammals, birds, and fish. Studies show that neonics bind human nicotinicacetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and cause cellular toxicity. In the dopaminergic Lund human mesencephalic (LUHMES) cell line, IMI and other neonics (10-100 μM) have been recently shown to activate intracellular calcium signaling through nAChRs. Thus, we examined proteomic responses of LUHMES cells to a 48-h treatment with 50 μM IMI, IMI-olefin, or DN-IMI. Our findings show differential effects of these neonics on cellular protein expression. Bioinformatic analysis of significantly altered proteins indicates an effect of IMI, IMI-olefin, and DN-IMI on protein synthesis and ribosomal function. These findings suggest a role for protein synthesis and transcriptional regulation in neonic-mediated dopaminergic neurotoxicity.
