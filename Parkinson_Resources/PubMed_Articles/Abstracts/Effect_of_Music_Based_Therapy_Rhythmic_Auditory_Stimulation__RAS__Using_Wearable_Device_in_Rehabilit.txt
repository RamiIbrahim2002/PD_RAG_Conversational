Title: Effect of Music Based Therapy Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) Using Wearable Device in Rehabilitation of Neurological Patients: A Systematic Review.
PMID: 37447782

Abstract:
(1) Background: Even though music therapy is acknowledged to have positive benefits in neurology, there is still a lack of knowledge in the literature about the applicability of music treatments in clinical practice with a neurological population using wearable devices. (2) Methods: a systematic review was conducted following PRISMA 2020 guidelines on the 29 October 2022, searching in five databases: PubMed, PEDro, Medline, Web of Science, and Science Direct. (3) Results: A total of 2964 articles were found, including 413 from PubMed, 248 from Web of Science, 2110 from Science Direct, 163 from Medline, and none from PEDro. Duplicate entries, of which there were 1262, were eliminated. In the first screening phase, 1702 papers were screened for title and abstract. Subsequently, 1667 papers were removed, based on population, duplicate, outcome, and poor study design. Only 15 studies were considered after 35 papers had their full texts verified. Results showed significant values of spatiotemporal gait parameters in music-based therapy rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS), including speed, stride length, cadence, and ROM. (4) Conclusions: The current findings confirm the value of music-based therapy RAS as a favorable and effective tool to implement in the health care system for the rehabilitation of patients with movement disorders.
