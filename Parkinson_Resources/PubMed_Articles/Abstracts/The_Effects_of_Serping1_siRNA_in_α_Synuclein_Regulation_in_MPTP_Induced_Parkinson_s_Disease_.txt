Title: The Effects of Serping1 siRNA in α-Synuclein Regulation in MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37509591

Abstract:
Our understanding of the gastrointestinal system in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) has grown considerably over the last two decades. Patients with PD experience notable gastrointestinal symptoms, including constipation. In this study, the effects of knocked-down serping1, associated with the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle and inflammation responses, by applying the serping1 siRNA were investigated in 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced PD mice in an α-syn change aspect. In the result, serping1 expression was knocked down by the treatment of serping1 siRNA, and decreased serping1 induced the decrease α-syn in the colon. Furthermore, the changes in α-syn aggregation were also examined in the brain, and alleviated α-syn aggregation was also observed in an <i>serping1</i> siRNA treatment group. The results indicated that serping1 siRNA could ease synucleinopathy related to the gastrointestinal system in PD. This study also raises the possibility that serping1 siRNA could alleviate α-syn aggregation in striatum and substantia nigra regions of the brain.
