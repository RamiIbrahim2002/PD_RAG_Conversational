Title: Neuromelanin-Sensitive Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a Measure for Differential Diagnosis of Essential Tremor and Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37635504

Abstract:
We sought to evaluate whether the neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) features of the substantia nigra (SN) have utility in the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET). This study enrolled 23 patients with PD, 20 patients with ET, and 18 healthy participants. All subjects underwent clinical examination, motor and cognitive assessments, and NM-MRI scans. The area and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) values of SN were defined according to NM-MRI images. Then, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to characterize the diagnostic power of the SN area and CNR values of SN. Compared with ET and control groups, the PD group showed a significant reduction of the area of SN (P = 0.003, PD vs. ET; P = 0.001, PD vs. control) and in the SN to midbrain area ratio in the same layer (P = 0.006, PD vs. ET; P = 0.005, PD vs. control). The SN area had a sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 87% for distinguishing ET from PD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.7630 and a Youden index of 0.5200, whereas the ratio of the SN area to midbrain area in the same layer had a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 87% for distinguishing ET from PD, with an AUC of 0.7478 and a Youden index of 0.4700. Compared with the ET group, the mean CNR value of the SN and the respective CNR values of the three subregions were all weakened in the PD group, and only the CNR in the middle part was significantly different from the control group (P = 0.006). The sensitivity of the CNR value of the middle part of the SN for differentiating ET from PD was 65%, the specificity was 87%, the AUC was 0.7500, and the Youden index was 0.5200.Based on our findings, we conclude that NM-MRI can improve diagnostic accuracy in PD and can be used as a specific and sensitive potential diagnostic biomarker for PD.
