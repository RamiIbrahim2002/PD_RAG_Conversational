PMID: 37943296

Abstract:
Mirtazapine (MTZ) is an antidepressant drug with an exceptional pharmacological profile. It also has an excellent safety and tolerability profile. The present review provides a pharmacological update on MTZ and summarizes the research findings of MTZ's effects on different diseases. MTZ is hypothesized to have antidepressant effects because of the synergy between noradrenergic and serotonergic actions and is effective in treating major depressive disorder and depression associated with epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease. In cancer patients, MTZ significantly reduced sadness, nausea, sleep disruption, and pain and improved quality of life. Also, it has promising effects on Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, dysthymia, social anxiety disorder, alcohol dependency, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, pain syndromes, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and sleep disorders. Additionally, MTZ is potentially therapeutic in different situations associated with depression, such as liver, kidney, cardiovascular, respiratory, infertility, heavy metal-induced neurotoxicity, and pruritus. Potent antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic bioactivities mediate these promising effects. These positive outcomes of the scientific investigations motivate more and more clinical trials for a golden exceptional antidepressant in different conditions.
