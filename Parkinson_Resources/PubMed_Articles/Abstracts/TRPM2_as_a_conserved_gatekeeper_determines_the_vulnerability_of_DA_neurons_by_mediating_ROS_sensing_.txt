Title: TRPM2 as a conserved gatekeeper determines the vulnerability of DA neurons by mediating ROS sensing and calcium dyshomeostasis.
PMID: 37739206

Abstract:
Different dopaminergic (DA) neuronal subgroups exhibit distinct vulnerability to stress, while the underlying mechanisms are elusive. Here we report that the transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel is preferentially expressed in vulnerable DA neuronal subgroups, which correlates positively with aging in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Overexpression of human TRPM2 in the DA neurons of C. elegans resulted in selective death of ADE but not CEP neurons in aged worms. Mechanistically, TRPM2 activation mediates FZO-1/CED-9-dependent mitochondrial hyperfusion and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), leading to ADE death. In mice, TRPM2 knockout reduced vulnerable substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) DA neuronal death induced by stress. Moreover, the TRPM2-mediated vulnerable DA neuronal death pathway is conserved from C. elegans to toxin-treated mice model and PD patient iPSC-derived DA neurons. The vulnerable SNc DA neuronal loss is the major symptom and cause of PD, and therefore the TRPM2-mediated pathway serves as a promising therapeutic target against PD.
