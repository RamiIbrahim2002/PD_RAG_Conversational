Title: Dietary Copper Intake and Risk of Parkinson's Disease: a Cross-sectional Study.
PMID: 37462848

Abstract:
Copper is an essential trace element for the human body. The epidemiological evidence for the association of dietary intake of copper with the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) is limited. We conducted an evaluation of the cross-sectional data gathered from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys spanning from 2007 to 2018, which comprised a total of 17,948 participants. To discern the distinct characteristics of the participants, we performed a univariate analysis and utilized a 1:2 ratio propensity score matching method to minimize the effects of selection bias. We employed weighted univariate as well as three multivariate logistic regression models both prior to and following matching, with the aim of examining the association between dietary copper intake and PD risk. Finally, we used the restricted cubic spline (RCS) methodology in order to investigate possible non-linear relationships. Furthermore, subgroup analysis was undertaken to elicit further understanding concerning the association between copper intake and PD. A negative correlation resulted between dietary copper intake and PD risk in both univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, prior to and following matching. Our findings demonstrate that there is a nonlinear, dose-dependent relationship between copper intake and PD, according to our RCS analysis. In subgroup analysis, copper intake was identified as an important protective factor for individuals who were non-Hispanic White, unmarried, and had completed higher education. Dietary copper intake was associated with the risk of PD. Supplementation of dietary copper may have potentially beneficial effects.
