Title: Development of <sup>18</sup>F-Labeled PET Tracer Candidates for Imaging of the Abelson Non-receptor Tyrosine Kinase in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37712438

Abstract:
Activated Abelson non-receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) plays a harmful role in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Inhibition of c-Abl is reported to have a neuroprotective effect and be a promising therapeutic strategy for PD. We have previously identified a series of benzo[<i>d</i>]thiazole derivatives as selective c-Abl inhibitors from which one compound showed high therapeutic potential. Herein, we report the development of a complementary positron emission tomography (PET) tracer. In total, three PET tracer candidates were developed and eventually radiolabeled with fluorine-18 for <i>in vivo</i> evaluation studies in mice. Candidate [<sup>18</sup>F]<b>3</b> was identified as the most promising compound, since it showed sufficient brain uptake, good washout kinetics, and satisfactory metabolic stability. In conclusion, we believe this tracer provides a good starting point to further validate and explore c-Abl as a target for therapeutic strategies against PD supported by PET.
