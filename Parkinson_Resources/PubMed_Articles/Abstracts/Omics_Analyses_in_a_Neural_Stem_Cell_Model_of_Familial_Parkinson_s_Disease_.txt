Title: Omics Analyses in a Neural Stem Cell Model of Familial Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37525039

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide. Despite considerable efforts, the underlying pathological mechanisms remain elusive, and yet, no treatment has been developed to efficiently reverse or modify disease progression. Thus, new experimental models are required to provide insights into the pathology of PD. Small-molecule neural precursor cells (smNPCs) are ideal for the study of neurodegenerative disorders due to their neural identity and stem cell properties. Cytoplasmic aggregates of α-synuclein (αSyn) are considered a hallmark of PD and a point mutation in the gene encoding p.A53T is responsible for a familial PD form with earlier and robust symptom onset. In order to study the cellular pathology of PD, we genetically modified smNPCs to inducibly overexpress EYFP-SNCA A53T. This cellular model was biochemically characterized, while dysregulated biological pathways and key regulators of PD pathology were identified by computational analyses. Our study indicates three novel genes, UBA52, PIP5K1A, and RPS2, which may mediate PD cellular pathology.
