Title: Eriocalyxin B alleviated ischemic cerebral injury by limiting microglia-mediated excessive neuroinflammation in mice.
PMID: 37839867

Abstract:
Excessive neuroinflammation mediated by microglia has a detrimental effect on the progression of ischemic stroke. Eriocalyxin B (EriB) was found with a neuroprotective effect in mice with Parkinson's disease via the suppression of microglial overactivation. This study aimed to investigate the roles of EriB in permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) mice. The pMCAO was induced in the internal carotid artery of the mice by the intraluminal filament method, and EriB (10 mg/kg) was administered immediately after surgery by intraperitoneal injection. The behavior score, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazole chloride staining, Nissl staining, TUNEL, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, PCR, ELISA, and immunoblotting revealed that EriB administration reduced brain infarct and neuron death and ameliorated neuroinflammation and microglia overactivation in pMCAO mice, manifested by alterations of TUNEL-positive cell numbers, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1)-positive cell numbers, and expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 6, IL-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and arginase 1. In addition, EriB suppressed ischemia-induced activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in the brain penumbra, suggesting the involvement of NF-κB in EriB function. In conclusion, EriB exerted anti-inflammatory effects in ischemia stroke by regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, and this may provide insights into the neuroprotective effect of EriB in the treatment of ischemic stroke.
