Title: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Biomarkers of Punding in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37891792

Abstract:
Punding is a rare condition triggered by dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by a complex, excessive, repetitive, and purposeless abnormal movement, and its pathogenesis remains unclear. We aimed to assess the brain structure alterations related to punding by using multipametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thirty-eight PD patients (19 with punding and 19 without punding) from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) were included in this study. Cortical thickness was assessed with FreeSurfer, and the integrity of white matter fiber tracts and network topologies were analyzed by using FMRIB Software Library (FSL) and Pipeline for Analyzing braiN Diffusion imAges (PANDA). PD patients with punding showed a higher apathy score and more severe cortical atrophy in the left superior parietal, right inferior parietal, and right superior frontal gyrus, and worse integrity of the right cingulum cingulate tract compared to those without punding. On the other hand, no significant difference in structural network topologies was detected between the two groups. These data suggest that the specific area of destruction may be an MRI biomarker of punding risk, and these findings may have important implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of punding in PD.
