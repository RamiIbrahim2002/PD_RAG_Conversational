Title: Research progress in clinical trials of stem cell therapy for stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.
PMID: 37786546

Abstract:
The incidence of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases is gradually increasing in modern society, but there is still no treatment that is effective enough. Stem cells are cells that can reproduce (self-renew) and differentiate into the body, which have shown significance in basic research, while doctors have also taken them into clinical trials to determine their efficacy and safety. Existing clinical trials mainly include middle-aged and elderly patients with stroke or Parkinson's disease (mostly 40-80 years old), mainly involving injection of mesenchymal stem cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells through the veins and the putamen, with a dosage of mostly 10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>8</sup> cells. The neural and motor functions of the patients were restored after stem cell therapy, and the safety was found to be good during the follow-up period of 3 months to 5 years. Here, we review all clinical trials and the latest advances in stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, with the hope that stem cell therapy will be used in the clinic in the future to achieve effective treatment rates and benefit patients.
