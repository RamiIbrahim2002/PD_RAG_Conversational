Title: Real-time Quantification of in vivo cerebrospinal fluid velocity using fMRI inflow effect.
PMID: 37961095

Abstract:
<i>In vivo</i> estimation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) velocity is crucial for understanding the glymphatic system and its potential role in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Current cardiac or respiratory gated approaches, such as 4D flow MRI, cannot capture CSF movement in real time due to limited temporal resolution and in addition deteriorate in accuracy at low fluid velocities. Other techniques like real-time PC-MRI or time-spatial labeling inversion pulse are not limited by temporal averaging but have limited availability even in research settings. This study aims to quantify the inflow effect of dynamic CSF motion on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for <i>in vivo</i>, real-time measurement of CSF flow velocity. We considered linear and nonlinear models of velocity waveforms and empirically fit them to fMRI data from a controlled flow experiment. To assess the utility of this methodology in human data, CSF flow velocities were computed from fMRI data acquired in eight healthy volunteers. Breath holding regimens were used to amplify CSF flow oscillations. Our experimental flow study revealed that CSF velocity is nonlinearly related to inflow effect-mediated signal increase and well estimated using an extension of a previous nonlinear framework. Using this relationship, we recovered velocity from <i>in vivo</i> fMRI signal, demonstrating the potential of our approach for estimating CSF flow velocity in the human brain. This novel method could serve as an alternative approach to quantifying slow flow velocities in real time, such as CSF flow in the ventricular system, thereby providing valuable insights into the glymphatic system's function and its implications for neurological disorders.
