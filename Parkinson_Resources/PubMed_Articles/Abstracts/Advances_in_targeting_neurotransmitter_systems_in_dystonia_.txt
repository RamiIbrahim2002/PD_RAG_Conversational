Title: Advances in targeting neurotransmitter systems in dystonia.
PMID: 37482394

Abstract:
Dystonia is characterised as uncontrolled, often painful involuntary muscle contractions that cause abnormal postures and repetitive or twisting movements. These movements can be continuous or sporadic and affect different parts of the body and range in severity. Dystonia and its related conditions present a huge cause of neurological morbidity worldwide. Although therapies are available, achieving optimal symptom control without major unwanted effects remains a challenge. Most pharmacological treatments for dystonia aim to modulate the effects of one or more neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, but doing so effectively and with precision is far from straightforward. In this chapter we discuss the physiology of key neurotransmitters, including dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, adenosine and cannabinoids, and their role in dystonia. We explore the ways in which existing pharmaceuticals as well as novel agents, currently in clinical trial or preclinical development, target dystonia, and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss current and emerging genetic therapies which may be used to treat genetic forms of dystonia.
