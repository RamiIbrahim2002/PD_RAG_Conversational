Title: The association between migraine and Parkinson's disease: a nationwide cohort study.
PMID: 38186247

Abstract:
Clinical studies have suggested an association between migraine and the occurrence of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is unknown whether migraine affects PD risk. We aimed to investigate the incidence of PD in patients with migraine and to determine the risk factors affecting the association between migraine and PD incidence.
