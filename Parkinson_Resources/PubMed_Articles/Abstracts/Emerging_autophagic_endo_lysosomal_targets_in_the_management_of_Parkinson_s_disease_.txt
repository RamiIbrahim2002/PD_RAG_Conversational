Title: Emerging autophagic endo-lysosomal targets in the management of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37586941

Abstract:
Synucleopathies, specifically Parkinson's disease, are still incurable and available therapeutic options are scarce and symptomatic. The autophagy-lysosomal-endosomal system is an indigenous mechanism to manage the proteome. Excess/misfolded protein accumulation activates this system, which degrades the undesired proteins via lysosomes. Cells also eliminate these proteins by releasing them into the extracellular space via exosomes. However, the sutophagy-lysosomal-endosomal system becomes unfunctional in Parkinson's disease and there is accumulation and spread of pathogenic alpha-synuclein. Neuronal degeneration results Owing to pathogenic alpha-synuclein. Thus, the autophagy-lysosomal-endosomal system could be a promising target for neuroprotection. In the present review, we discuss the autophagy-lysosomal-endosomal system as an emerging target for the management of Parkinson's disease. Modulation of these targets associated with the autophagy-lysosomal-endosomal system can aid in clearing pathogenic alpha-synuclein and prevent the degeneration of neurons.
