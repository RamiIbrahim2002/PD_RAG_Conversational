Title: Voxel-based morphometry of grey matter structures in Parkinson's Disease with wearing-off.
PMID: 37735325

Abstract:
Our study aimed to investigate the grey matter (GM) changes using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with wearing-off (WO). 3D-T1-weighted imaging was performed on 48 PD patients without wearing-off (PD-nWO), 39 PD patients with wearing-off (PD-WO) and 47 age and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). 3D structural images were analyzed by VBM procedure with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) to detect grey matter volume. Widespread areas of grey matter changes were found in patients among three groups (in bilateral frontal, temporal lobes, lingual gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus, right precuneus, right superior parietal gyrus and right cerebellum). Grey matter reductions were found in frontal lobe (right middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus), right parietal lobe (precuneus, superior parietal gyrus, postcentral gyrus), right temporal lobe (superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus), bilateral lingual gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus in PD-WO group compared with the PD-nWO group. Our results suggesting that wearing-off may be associated with grey matter atrophy in the cortical areas. These findings may aid in a better understanding of the brain degeneration process in PD with wearing-off.
