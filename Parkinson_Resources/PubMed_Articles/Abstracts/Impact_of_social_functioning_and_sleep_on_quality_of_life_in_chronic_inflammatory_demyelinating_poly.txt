Title: Impact of social-functioning and sleep on quality of life in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
PMID: 37866209

Abstract:
The impact of impairment of social functioning and sleep on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), is unknown in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). The value of the Chronic Acquired Polyneuropathy Patient-Reported Index (CAP-PRI) to identify potential social functioning and sleep issues is equally unknown.
