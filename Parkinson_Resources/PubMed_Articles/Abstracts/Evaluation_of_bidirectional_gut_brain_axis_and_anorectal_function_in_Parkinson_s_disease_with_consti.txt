Title: Evaluation of bidirectional gut-brain axis and anorectal function in Parkinson's disease with constipation.
PMID: 38105462

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder with prodromal and highly prevalent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, especially constipation. Although PD models suggest gut-brain axis dysfunction, the mechanistic underpinnings and their correlation with GI symptoms are poorly understood.
