Title: Disrupted topologic efficiency of brain functional connectome in de novo Parkinson's disease with depression.
PMID: 37857484

Abstract:
Growing evidence supports that depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) depends on disruptions in specific neural networks rather than regional dysfunction. According to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, the study attempted to decipher the alterations in the topological properties of brain networks in de novo depression in PD (DPD). The study also explored the neural network basis for depressive symptoms in PD. We recruited 20 DPD, 37 non-depressed PD and 41 healthy controls (HC). The Graph theory and network-based statistical methods helped analyse the topological properties of brain functional networks and anomalous subnetworks across these groups. The relationship between altered properties and depression severity was also investigated. DPD revealed significantly reduced nodal efficiency in the left superior temporal gyrus. Additionally, DPD decreased five hubs, primarily located in the temporal-occipital cortex, and increased seven hubs, mainly distributed in the limbic cortico-basal ganglia circuit. The betweenness centrality of the left Medio Ventral Occipital Cortex was positively associated with depressive scores in DPD. In contrast to HC, DPD had a multi-connected subnetwork with significantly lower connectivity, primarily distributed in the visual, somatomotor, dorsal attention and default networks. Regional topological disruptions in the temporal-occipital region are critical in the DPD neurological mechanism. It might suggest a potential network biomarker among newly diagnosed DPD patients.
