Title: Parkinson's Disease, Impulsive-Compulsive Behaviors, and Health-Related Quality of Life.
PMID: 37926510

Abstract:
A large body of literature has examined the links between the use of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the development of "impulsive-compulsive behaviors (ICBs)." Little is known regarding the link between the development of ICBs and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We aimed to explore the factors that are associated with poorer HRQOL, especially in relation to DRT-induced ICBs, in a sample of PD patients.
