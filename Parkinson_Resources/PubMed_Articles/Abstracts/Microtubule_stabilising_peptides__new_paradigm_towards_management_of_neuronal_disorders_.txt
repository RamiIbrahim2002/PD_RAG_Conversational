Title: Microtubule stabilising peptides: new paradigm towards management of neuronal disorders.
PMID: 37974959

Abstract:
Neuronal cells made of soma, axon, and dendrites are highly compartmentalized and possess a specialized transport system that can convey long-distance electrical signals for the cross-talk. The transport system is made up of microtubule (MT) polymers and MT-binding proteins. MTs play vital and diverse roles in various cellular processes. Therefore, defects and dysregulation of MTs and their binding proteins lead to many neurological disorders as exemplified by Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and many others. MT-stabilising agents (MSAs) altering the MT-associated protein connections have shown great potential for several neurodegenerative disorders. Peptides are an important class of molecules with high specificity, biocompatibility and are devoid of side effects. In the past, peptides have been explored in various neuronal disorders as therapeutics. Davunetide, a MT-stabilising octapeptide, has entered into phase II clinical trials for schizophrenia. Numerous examples of peptides emerging as MSAs reflect the emergence of a new paradigm for peptides which can be explored further as drug candidates for neuronal disorders. Although small molecule-based MSAs have been reviewed in the past, there is no systematic review in recent years focusing on peptides as MSAs apart from davunetide in 2013. Therefore, a systematic updated review on MT stabilising peptides may shed light on many hidden aspects and enable researchers to develop new therapies for diseases related to the CNS. In this review we have summarised the recent examples of peptides as MSAs.
