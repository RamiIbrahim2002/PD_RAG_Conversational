Title: Parkin regulates amino acid homeostasis at mitochondria-lysosome (M/L) contact sites in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37467322

Abstract:
Mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin are the most common cause of early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Although parkin modulates mitochondrial and endolysosomal homeostasis during cellular stress, whether parkin regulates mitochondrial and lysosomal cross-talk under physiologic conditions remains unresolved. Using transcriptomics, metabolomics and super-resolution microscopy, we identify amino acid metabolism as a disrupted pathway in iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons from patients with parkin PD. Compared to isogenic controls, parkin mutant neurons exhibit decreased mitochondria-lysosome contacts via destabilization of active Rab7. Subcellular metabolomics in parkin mutant neurons reveals amino acid accumulation in lysosomes and their deficiency in mitochondria. Knockdown of the Rab7 GTPase-activating protein TBC1D15 restores mitochondria-lysosome tethering and ameliorates cellular and subcellular amino acid profiles in parkin mutant neurons. Our data thus uncover a function of parkin in promoting mitochondrial and lysosomal amino acid homeostasis through stabilization of mitochondria-lysosome contacts and suggest that modulation of interorganelle contacts may serve as a potential target for ameliorating amino acid dyshomeostasis in disease.
