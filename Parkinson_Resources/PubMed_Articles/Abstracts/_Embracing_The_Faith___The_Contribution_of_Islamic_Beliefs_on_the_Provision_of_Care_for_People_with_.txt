Abstract:
This study examines the impact of Islamic beliefs on the caregiving practices of individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in Indonesia and New Zealand. The study sample comprised seventeen caregivers who participated inÂ semi-structured interviews which were analysed using the method of inductive thematic analysis. The study delineated three overarching themes: value-driven caregiving, comprehensive care and caregivers strengthened by faith and practice. This study examined the practical applications of the Quran, Hadith and Muslim beliefs in caregiver experiences. Further research is necessary to enhance the support systems for Muslim caregivers in various circumstances, facilitating the advancement of solutions to contemporary social problems.
