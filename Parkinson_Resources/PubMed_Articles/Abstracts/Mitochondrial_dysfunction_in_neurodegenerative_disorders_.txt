Title: Mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders.
PMID: 38241161

Abstract:
Recent advances in understanding the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases have expanded the opportunities for neurotherapeutics targeting mitochondria to alleviate symptoms and slow disease progression. In this review, we offer a historical account of advances in mitochondrial biology and neurodegenerative disease. Additionally, we summarize current knowledge of the normal physiology of mitochondria and the pathogenesis of mitochondrial dysfunction, the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease, current therapeutics and recent therapeutic advances, as well as future directions for neurotherapeutics targeting mitochondrial function. A focus is placed on reactive oxygen species and their role in the disruption of telomeres and their effects on the epigenome. The effects of mitochondrial dysfunction in the etiology and progression of Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are discussed in depth. Current clinical trials for mitochondria-targeting neurotherapeutics are discussed.
