Title: Novel systemic delivery of a peptide-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide to reduce α-synuclein in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.
PMID: 37690676

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative disorders of aging are characterized by the progressive accumulation of proteins such as α-synuclein (α-syn) and amyloid beta (Aβ). Misfolded and aggregated α-syn has been implicated in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, but less so in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), despite the fact that accumulation of α-syn has been confirmed in over 50% of postmortem brains neuropathologically diagnosed with AD. To date, no therapeutic strategy has effectively or consistently downregulated α-syn in AD. Here we tested the hypothesis that by using a systemically-delivered peptide (ApoB<sup>11</sup>) bound to a modified antisense oligonucleotide against α-syn (ASO-α-syn), we can downregulate α-syn expression in an AD mouse model and improve behavioral and neuropathologic phenotypes. Our results demonstrate that monthly systemic treatment with of ApoB<sup>11</sup>:ASO α-syn beginning at 6 months of age reduces expression of α-synuclein in the brains of 9-month-old AD mice. Downregulation of α-syn led to reduction in Aβ plaque burden, prevented neuronal loss and astrogliosis. Furthermore, we found that AD mice treated with ApoB<sup>11</sup>:ASO α-syn had greatly improved hippocampal and spatial memory function in comparison to their control counterparts. Collectively, our data supports the reduction of α-syn through use of systemically-delivered ApoB<sup>11</sup>:ASO α-syn as a promising future disease-modifying therapeutic for AD.
