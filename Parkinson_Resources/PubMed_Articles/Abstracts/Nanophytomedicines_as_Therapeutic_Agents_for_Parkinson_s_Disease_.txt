Title: Nanophytomedicines as Therapeutic Agents for Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 38024675

Abstract:
Phytochemicals are promising therapeutics for various neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). However, their efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and penetration across the blood-brain barrier can be improved using delivery systems such as nanoparticles. We reviewed recently published work in which nanoparticles were used to deliver phytochemicals toward PD treatment. The studies show that nanoparticles not only improve the pharmacological effect of the phytochemicals but also enable targeting to the brain and crossing of the blood-brain barrier. Various ligands were added to the nanoparticles to improve blood-brain barrier transportation. The promising findings from the published studies reveal that more research into nanophytomedicine approaches as therapeutic targets for PD is warranted, especially since they have the potential to protect against key features of PD, including Î±-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dopaminergic neuronal death. Furthermore, future directions should involve smart designs to tailor nanoparticles for improved therapeutic delivery by modifying their features, such as architecture, surface and material properties, targeting ligands, and responsiveness.
