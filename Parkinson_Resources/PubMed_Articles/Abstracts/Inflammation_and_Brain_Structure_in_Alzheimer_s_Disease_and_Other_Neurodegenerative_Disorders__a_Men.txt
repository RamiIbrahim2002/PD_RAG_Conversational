Title: Inflammation and Brain Structure in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurodegenerative Disorders: a Mendelian Randomization Study.
PMID: 37736795

Abstract:
Previous in vitro and post-mortem studies have reported the role of inflammation in neurodegenerative disorders. However, the association between inflammation and brain structure in vivo and the transcriptome-driven functional basis with relevance to neurodegenerative disorders remains elusive. The aim of the present study is to identify the association among inflammation, brain structure, and neurodegenerative disorders at genetic and transcriptomic levels. Genetic variants associated with inflammatory cytokines were selected from the latest and largest genome-wide association studies of European ancestry. Neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and brain structure imaging measures were selected as the outcomes. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were conducted to identify the causal associations. Single-nucleus transcriptome data of the occipitotemporal cortex was further analyzed to identify the differential expressed genes in AD, which were tested for biological processes and protein interaction network. MR analysis indicated that genetically predicted TREM2 and sTREM2 were significantly associated with AD (TREM2: z-score = -9.088, p-value = 1.02 × 10<sup>-19</sup>; sTREM2: z-score = -7.495, p-value = 6.61 × 10<sup>-14</sup>). The present study found no evidence to support the causal associations between other inflammatory cytokines and the risks of AD, PD, ALS, or DLB. Genetically predicted TREM2 was significantly associated with the cortical thickness of inferior temporal (z-score = -4.238, p-value = 2.26 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and pole temporal (z-score = -4.549, p-value = 5.40 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). In the occipitotemporal cortex samples, microglia were the main source of TREM2 gene and showed increasing expression of genes associated with inflammation and immunity. The present study has leveraged genetic and transcriptomic data to identify the association among TREM2, temporal lobe, and AD and the underlying cellular and molecular basis, thus providing a new perspective on the role of TREM2 in AD and insights into the complex associations among inflammation, brain structure, and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly AD.
