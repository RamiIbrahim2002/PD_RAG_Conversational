Title: Scalable, flexible carbon fiber electrode thread arrays for three-dimensional probing of neurochemical activity in deep brain structures of rodents.
PMID: 37708685

Abstract:
We developed a flexible "electrode-thread" array for recording dopamine neurochemicals from a lateral distribution of subcortical targets (up to 16) transverse to the axis of insertion. Ultrathin (∼10 μm diameter) carbon fiber (CF) electrode-threads (CFETs) are clustered into a tight bundle to introduce them into the brain from a single-entry point. The individual CFETs splay laterally in deep brain tissue during insertion due to their innate flexibility. This spatial redistribution allows navigation of the CFETs towards deep brain targets spreading horizontally from the axis of insertion. Commercial "linear" arrays provide single-entry insertion but only allow measurements along the axis of insertion. Horizontally configured arrays inflict separate penetrations for each individual channel. We tested functional performance of our CFET arrays in vivo for recording dopamine and for providing lateral spread to multiple distributed sites in the rat striatum. Spatial spread was further characterized in agar brain phantoms as a function of insertion depth. We also developed protocols to slice the embedded CFETs within fixed brain tissue using standard histology. This method allowed extraction of the precise spatial coordinates of the implanted CFETs and their recording sites as integrated with immunohistochemical staining for surrounding anatomical, cytological, and protein expression labels. Our CFET array has the potential to unlock a wide range of applications, from uncovering the role of neuromodulators in synaptic plasticity, to addressing critical safety barriers in clinical translation towards diagnostic and adaptive treatment in Parkinson's disease and major mood disorders.
