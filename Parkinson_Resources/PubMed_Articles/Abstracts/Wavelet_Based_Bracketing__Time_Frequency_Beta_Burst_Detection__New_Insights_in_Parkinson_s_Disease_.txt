Title: Wavelet-Based Bracketing, Time-Frequency Beta Burst Detection: New Insights in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37819489

Abstract:
Studies have shown that beta band activity is not tonically elevated but comprises exaggerated phasic bursts of varying durations and magnitudes, for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Current methods for detecting beta bursts target a single frequency peak in beta band, potentially ignoring bursts in the wider beta band. In this study, we propose a new robust framework for beta burst identification across wide frequency ranges. Chronic local field potential at-rest recordings were obtained from seven PD patients implanted with Medtronic SenSight™ deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes. The proposed method uses wavelet decomposition to compute the time-frequency spectrum and identifies bursts spanning multiple frequency bins by thresholding, offering an additional burst measure, ∆f, that captures the width of a burst in the frequency domain. Analysis included calculating burst duration, magnitude, and ∆f and evaluating the distribution and likelihood of bursts between the low beta (13-20 Hz) and high beta (21-35 Hz). Finally, the results of the analysis were correlated to motor impairment (MDS-UPDRS III) med off scores. We found that low beta bursts with longer durations and larger width in the frequency domain (∆f) were positively correlated, while high beta bursts with longer durations and larger ∆f were negatively correlated with motor impairment. The proposed method, finding clear differences between bursting behavior in high and low beta bands, has clearly demonstrated the importance of considering wide frequency bands for beta burst behavior with implications for closed-loop DBS paradigms.
