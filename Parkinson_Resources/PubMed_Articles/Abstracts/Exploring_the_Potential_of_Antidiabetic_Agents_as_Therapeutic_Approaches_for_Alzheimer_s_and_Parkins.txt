Title: Exploring the Potential of Antidiabetic Agents as Therapeutic Approaches for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases: A Comprehensive Review.
PMID: 37809189

Abstract:
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are two prevalent neurodegenerative disorders with significant societal and healthcare burdens. The search for effective therapeutic approaches to combat these diseases has led to growing interest in exploring the potential of antidiabetic agents. This comprehensive review aims to provide a detailed overview of the current literature on using antidiabetic agents as therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. We discuss the underlying pathological mechanisms of these neurodegenerative diseases, including protein misfolding, inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. We then delve into the potential mechanisms by which antidiabetic agents may exert neuroprotective effects, including regulation of glucose metabolism and insulin signaling, anti-inflammatory effects, modulation of oxidative stress, and improvement of mitochondrial function and bioenergetics. We highlight in vitro, animal, and clinical studies that support the potential benefits of antidiabetic agents in reducing disease pathology and improving clinical outcomes. However, we also acknowledge these agents' limitations, variability in treatment response, and potential side effects. Furthermore, we explore emerging therapeutic targets and novel approaches, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptorÂ (GLP-1R) agonists, insulin sensitizer drugs, neuroinflammation-targeted therapies, and precision medicine approaches. The review concludes by emphasizing the need for further research, including large-scale clinical trials, to validate the efficacy and safety of antidiabetic agents in treating Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and pharmaceutical companies is essential in advancing the field and effectively treating patients affected by these debilitating neurodegenerative disorders.
