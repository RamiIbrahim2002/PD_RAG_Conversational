Title: Biosensors, Recent Advances in Determination of BDNF and NfL.
PMID: 37605014

Abstract:
Key biomarkers such as Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Neurofilament light chain (NfL) play important roles in the development and progression of many neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. In these clinical conditions, the underlying biomarker processes are markedly heterogeneous. In this context, robust biomarker discovery is of critical importance for screening, early detection, and monitoring of neurological diseases. The difficulty of directly identifying biochemical processes in the central nervous system (CNS) is challenging. In recent years, biomarkers of CNS inflammatory response have been identified in various body fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and tears. Furthermore, biotechnology and nanotechnology have facilitated the development of biosensor platforms capable of real-time detection of multiple biomarkers in clinically relevant samples. Biosensing technology is approaching maturity and will be deployed in communities, at which point screening programs and personalized medicine will become a reality. In this multidisciplinary review, our goal is to highlight clinical and current technological advances in the development of multiplex-based solutions for effective diagnosis and monitoring of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. The trend in the detection if BDNF and NfL.
