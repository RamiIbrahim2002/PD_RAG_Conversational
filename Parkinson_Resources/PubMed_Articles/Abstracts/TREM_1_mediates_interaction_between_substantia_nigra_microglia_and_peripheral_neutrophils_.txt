Abstract:
Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is considered a pathological feature of Parkinson’s disease. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell-1 (TREM-1) can amplify the inherent immune response, and crucially, regulate inflammation. In this study, we found marked elevation of serum soluble TREM-1 in patients with Parkinson’s disease that positively correlated with Parkinson’s disease severity and dyskinesia. In a mouse model of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced Parkinson’s disease, we found that microglial TREM-1 expression also increased in the substantia nigra. Further, <i>TREM-1</i> knockout alleviated dyskinesia in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease and reduced dopaminergic neuronal injury. Meanwhile, <i>TREM-1</i> knockout attenuated the neuroinflammatory response, dopaminergic neuronal injury, and neutrophil migration. Next, we established an <i>in vitro</i> 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridine-induced BV2 microglia model of Parkinson’s disease and treated the cells with the TREM-1 inhibitory peptide LP17. We found that LP17 treatment reduced apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons and neutrophil migration. Moreover, inhibition of neutrophil TREM-1 activation diminished dopaminergic neuronal apoptosis induced by lipopolysaccharide. TREM-1 can activate the downstream CARD9/NF-κB proinflammatory pathway via interaction with SYK. These findings suggest that TREM-1 may play a key role in mediating the damage to dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson’s disease by regulating the interaction between microglia and peripheral neutrophils.
