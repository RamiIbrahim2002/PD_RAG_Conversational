Title: Implants talk to each-other: RF heating changes when two DBS leads are present simultaneously during MRI.
PMID: 38082747

Abstract:
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proven to be an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease and other brain disorders. The procedure often involves implanting two elongated leads aimed at specific brain nuclei in both the left and right hemispheres. However, evaluating the safety of MRI in patients with such implants has only been done on an individual lead basis, ignoring the possibility of crosstalk between the leads. This study evaluates the impact of crosstalk on power deposition at the lead tip through numerical simulation and phantom experiments. We used CT images to obtain patient-specific lead trajectories and compared the power deposition at the lead tip in cases with bilateral and unilateral DBS implants. Our results indicate that the RF power deposition at the lead tip can vary by up to 6-fold when two DBS leads are present together compared to when only one lead is present. Experimental measurements in a simplified case of two lead-only DBS systems confirmed the existence of crosstalk.Clinical Relevance-Our results indicate that RF heating of implanted leads during MRI can be affected by the presence of another lead in the body, which may increase or decrease the power deposition in the tissue depending on the position and configuration of the leads.
