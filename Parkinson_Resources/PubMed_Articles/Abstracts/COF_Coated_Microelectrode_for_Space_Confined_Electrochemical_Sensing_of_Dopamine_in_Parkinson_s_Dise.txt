PMID: 37859408

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the drastic depletion of dopamine (DA) in the striatum; thus, DA can act as a marker for PD diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation. However, detecting DA in the brain is not easy because of its low concentration and difficulty in sampling. In this work, we report the fabrication of a covalent organic framework (COF)-modified carbon fiber microelectrode (cCFE) that enables the real-time detection of DA in the mouse brain thanks to the outstanding antibiofouling and antichemical fouling ability, excellent analytical selectivity, and sensitivity offered by the COF modification. In particular, the COF can inhibit the polymerization of DA on the electrode (namely, chemical fouling) by spatially confining the molecular conformation and electrochemical oxidation of DA. The cCFE can stably and continuously work in the mouse brain to detect DA and monitor the variation of its concentration. Furthermore, it was combined with levodopa administration to devise a closed-loop feedback mode for PD diagnosis and therapy, in which the cCFE real-time monitors the concentration of DA in the PD model mouse brain to instruct the dose and injection time of levodopa, allowing a customized medication to improve therapeutic efficacy and meanwhile avoid adverse side effects. This work demonstrates the fascinating properties of a COF in fabricating electrochemical sensors for in vivo bioanalysis. We believe that the COF with structural tunability and diversity will offer enormous promise for selective detection of neurotransmitters in the brain.
