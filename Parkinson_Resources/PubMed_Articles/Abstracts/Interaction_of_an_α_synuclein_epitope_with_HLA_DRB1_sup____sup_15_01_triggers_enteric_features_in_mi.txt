Title: Interaction of an α-synuclein epitope with HLA-DRB1<sup>∗</sup>15:01 triggers enteric features in mice reminiscent of prodromal Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37597517

Abstract:
Enteric symptoms are hallmarks of prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD) that appear decades before the onset of motor symptoms and diagnosis. PD patients possess circulating T cells that recognize specific α-synuclein (α-syn)-derived epitopes. One epitope, α-syn<sub>32-46</sub>, binds with strong affinity to the HLA-DRB1<sup>∗</sup>15:01 allele implicated in autoimmune diseases. We report that α-syn<sub>32-46</sub> immunization in a mouse expressing human HLA-DRB1<sup>∗</sup>15:01 triggers intestinal inflammation, leading to loss of enteric neurons, damaged enteric dopaminergic neurons, constipation, and weight loss. α-Syn<sub>32-46</sub> immunization activates innate and adaptive immune gene signatures in the gut and induces changes in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>1/T<sub>H</sub>17 transcriptome that resemble tissue-resident memory (T<sub>RM</sub>) cells found in mucosal barriers during inflammation. Depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup>, but not CD8<sup>+</sup>, T cells partially rescues enteric neurodegeneration. Therefore, interaction of α-syn<sub>32-46</sub> and HLA-DRB1<sup>∗</sup>15:0 is critical for gut inflammation and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated loss of enteric neurons in humanized mice, suggesting mechanisms that may underlie prodromal enteric PD.
