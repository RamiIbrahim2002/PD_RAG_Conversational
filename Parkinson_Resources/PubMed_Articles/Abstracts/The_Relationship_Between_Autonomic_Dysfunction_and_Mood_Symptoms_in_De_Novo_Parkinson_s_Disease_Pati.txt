Title: The Relationship Between Autonomic Dysfunction and Mood Symptoms in De Novo Parkinson's Disease Patients Over Time.
PMID: 37831611

Abstract:
Autonomic dysfunction is prevalent in Parkinson's disease (PD) and can worsen quality of life. We examined: (a) whether specific autonomic symptoms were more strongly associated with anxiety or depression in PD and (b) whether overall autonomic dysfunction predicted mood trajectories over a 5-year period.
