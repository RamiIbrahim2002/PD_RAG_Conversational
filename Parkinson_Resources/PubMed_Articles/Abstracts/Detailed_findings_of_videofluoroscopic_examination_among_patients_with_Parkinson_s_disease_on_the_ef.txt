PMID: 38020611

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to various types of swallowing disorders. We investigated the effect of cervical percutaneous interferential current stimulation on dysphagia. By conducting detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of videofluoroscopic examination, we aimed to understand dysphagia in patients with PD and investigate its effects on swallowing function.
