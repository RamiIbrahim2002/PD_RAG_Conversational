PMID: 37923003

Abstract:
Depression associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) seriously affects patients, and there is a lack of effective treatments. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is increasingly used as a new non-invasive neuromodulation technique in the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. However, there is a paucity of research on tDCS for PD-related depression. Our study used PD model rats established with unilateral destruction of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) to observe the modulatory effects of tDCS acting on the mPFC on depression-like behaviors. We found that tDCS acting on the mPFC improved depression-like behaviors in PD model rats by increasing sucrose intake in sucrose preference test (n = 7-10 rats/group) and shortening immobility time in forced swimming test (n = 7-8 rats/group). Meanwhile, tDCS decreased the expression of c-Fos protein (n = 8-11 rats/group) and the excitation of glutamatergic neurons (n = 6-8 rats/group) in the PrL and LHb of PD model rats. Western blots showed that tDCS decreased the overexpression of serine 845 phosphorylation site of AMPA receptor GluR1 (p-GluR1-S845) in the PrL and LHb of PD model rats (n = 8-11 rats/group), and the overexpression of p-GluR1-S831 in the LHb (n = 8-11 rats/group). The results of this study show that tDCS acting on the mPFC helps to improve PD-related depression, which involves the modulation of excitability and AMPA receptor phosphorylation on the PrL and LHb neurons.
