Title: Combining fibril-induced alpha-synuclein aggregation and 6-hydroxydopamine in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease and the effect of cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor on the induced neurodegeneration.
PMID: 38072889

Abstract:
The existent pre-clinical models of Parkinson's disease do not simultaneously recapitulate severe degeneration of dopamine neurons and the occurrence of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation in one study system. In this study, we injected aSyn pre-formed fibrils (PFF) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilaterally into the striatum of C57BL/6 wild-type male mice at an interval of 2 weeks to induce aggregation of aSyn protein and trigger the loss of dopamine neurons simultaneously in one model and studied the behavioural effects of the combination in these mice. 6-OHDA was tested at three different doses, and 2 μg of 6-OHDA combined with PFF-induced aSyn aggregation was found to produce the most optimal disease phenotype. At 14 weeks timepoint, mice injected with a combination of PFF and 6-OHDA sustained significant damage to the nigrostriatal pathway and exhibited aSyn-positive aggregation. Our data suggest that the neurons that formed large aSyn aggregates were particularly vulnerable to 6-OHDA-induced degeneration. We also demonstrate the manifestation of a relatively aggressive pathology in 2- to 4-month-old mice, as compared to younger 7- to 9-week-old ones. Furthermore, cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) administered intrastriatally rescued dopamine neurons and motor behaviour of the animals to some extent from 6-OHDA toxicity. However, no such effect could be seen in the novel 6-OHDA + PFFs combination model. For the first time, we demonstrate the combined effect of PFF and 6-OHDA simultaneously in one model. We further discuss the scope for further optimizing this combination model to develop it as a promising pre-clinical platform for drug screening and development.
