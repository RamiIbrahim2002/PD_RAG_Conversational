PMID: 37839283

Abstract:
Previous studies demonstrated reduced incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD) with regular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) exposure, particularly ibuprofen. No studies have investigated the impact of NSAID exposure on markers of disease progression for established PD.
