Abstract:
Betahistine was registered in Europe in the 1970s and approved in more than 80 countries as a first-line treatment for Meni√®re's disease. It has been administered to more than 150 million patients. However, according to a Cochrane systematic review of betahistine and recent meta-analyses, there is insufficient evidence to say whether betahistine has any effect in the currently approved dosages of up to 48 mg/d. A combination with the monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor, selegiline, may increase the bioavailability of betahistine to levels similar to the well-established combination of L-DOPA with carbidopa or benserazide in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. We investigated the effect of selegiline on betahistine pharmacokinetics and the safety of the combination in humans.
