Title: Bridge-Like Lipid Transfer Proteins (BLTPs) in <i>C. elegans</i>: From Genetics to Structures and Functions.
PMID: 37455813

Abstract:
In eukaryotic cells, lipid transfer can occur at membrane contact sites (MCS) to facilitate the exchange of various lipids between two adjacent cellular organelle membranes. Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), including shuttle LTP or bridge-like LTP (BLTP), transport lipids at MCS and are critical for diverse cellular processes, including lipid metabolism, membrane trafficking, and cell signaling. BLTPs (BLTP1-5, including the ATG2 and VPS13 family proteins) contain lipid-accommodating hydrophobic repeating β-groove (RBG) domains that allow the bulk transfer of lipids through MCS. Compared with vesicular lipid transfer and shuttle LTP, BLTPs have been only recently identified. Their functions and regulatory mechanisms are currently being unraveled in various model organisms and by diverse approaches. In this review, we summarize the genetics, structural features, and biological functions of BLTP in the genetically tractable model organism <i>C. elegans</i>. We discuss our recent studies and findings on <i>C. elegans</i> LPD-3, a prototypical megaprotein ortholog of BLTP1, with identified lipid transfer functions that are evolutionarily conserved in multicellular organisms and in human cells. We also highlight areas for future research of BLTP using <i>C. elegans</i> and complementary model systems and approaches. Given the emerging links of BLTP to several human diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alkuraya-Kučinskas syndrome, discovering evolutionarily conserved roles of BLTPs and their mechanisms of regulation and action should contribute to new advances in basic cell biology and potential therapeutic development for related human disorders.
