Title: Post-translational modification and mitochondrial function in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38273938

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease with currently no cure. Most PD cases are sporadic, and about 5-10% of PD cases present a monogenic inheritance pattern. Mutations in more than 20 genes are associated with genetic forms of PD. Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered a prominent player in PD pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) allow rapid switching of protein functions and therefore impact various cellular functions including those related to mitochondria. Among the PD-associated genes, <i>Parkin</i>, <i>PINK1</i>, and <i>LRRK2</i> encode enzymes that directly involved in catalyzing PTM modifications of target proteins, while others like Î±-synuclein, FBXO7, HTRA2, VPS35, CHCHD2, and DJ-1, undergo substantial PTM modification, subsequently altering mitochondrial functions. Here, we summarize recent findings on major PTMs associated with PD-related proteins, as enzymes or substrates, that are shown to regulate important mitochondrial functions and discuss their involvement in PD pathogenesis. We will further highlight the significance of PTM-regulated mitochondrial functions in understanding PD etiology. Furthermore, we emphasize the potential for developing important biomarkers for PD through extensive research into PTMs.
