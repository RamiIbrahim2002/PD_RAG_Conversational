Title: Caenorhabditis elegans: A transgenic model for studying age-associated neurodegenerative diseases.
PMID: 37598759

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are a heterogeneous group of aging-associated ailments characterized by interrupting cellular proteostasic machinery and the misfolding of distinct proteins to form toxic aggregates in neurons. Neurodegenerative diseases, which include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), and others, are becoming an increasing threat to human health worldwide. The degeneration and death of certain specific groups of neurons are the hallmarks of these diseases. Over the past decades, Caenorhabditis eleganshas beenwidely used as a transgenic model to investigate biological processes related to health and disease. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has developed as a powerful tool for studying disease mechanisms due to its ease of genetic handling and instant cultivation while providing a whole-animal system amendable to several molecular and biochemical techniques. In this review, we elucidate the potential of C. elegans as a versatile platform for systematic dissection of the molecular basis of human disease, focusing on neurodegenerative disorders, and may help better our understanding of the disease mechanisms and search for new therapeutics for these devastating diseases.
