Title: Realizing brain therapy with "smart medicine": mechanism and case report of molecular hydrogen inhalation for Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 39073335

Abstract:
The Michael J. Fox Foundation has been funding research on Parkinson's disease for 35 years, but has yet to find a cure. This is due to a problem with the philosophy behind the development of modern medical treatments. In this paper, we will introduce "smart medicine" with a substance that can solve all the problems of central nervous system drugs. The substance is the smallest diatomic molecule, the hydrogen molecule. Due to their size, hydrogen molecules can easily penetrate the cell membrane and enter the brain. In the midbrain of Parkinson's disease patients, hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction cause a chain reaction of oxidation of dopamine, but hydrogen entering the midbrain can convert the hydroxyl radicals into water molecules and inhibit the oxidation of dopamine. In this paper, we focus on the etiology of neurological diseases, especially Parkinson's disease, and present a case in which hydrogen inhalation improves the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as body bending and hand tremor. And we confidently state that if Michael J. Fox encountered "smart medicine" that could be realized with molecular hydrogen, he would not be a "lucky man" but a "super-lucky man."
