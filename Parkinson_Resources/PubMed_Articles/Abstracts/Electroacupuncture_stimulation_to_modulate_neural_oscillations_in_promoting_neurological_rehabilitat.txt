Title: Electroacupuncture stimulation to modulate neural oscillations in promoting neurological rehabilitation.
PMID: 37884179

Abstract:
Electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation is a modern neuromodulation technique that integrates traditional Chinese acupuncture therapy with contemporary electrical stimulation. It involves the application of electrical currents to specific acupoints on the body following acupuncture. EA has been widely used in the treatment of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Recent research suggests that EA stimulation may modulate neural oscillations, correcting abnormal brain electrical activity, therefore promoting brain function and aiding in neurological rehabilitation. This paper conducted a comprehensive search in databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI using keywords like "electroacupuncture," "neural oscillations," and "neurorehabilitation", covering the period from year 1980 to 2023. We provide a detailed overview of how electroacupuncture stimulation modulates neural oscillations, including maintaining neural activity homeostasis, influencing neurotransmitter release, improving cerebral hemodynamics, and enhancing specific neural functional networks. The paper also discusses the current state of research, limitations of electroacupuncture-induced neural oscillation techniques, and explores prospects for their combined application, aiming to offer broader insights for both basic and clinical research.
