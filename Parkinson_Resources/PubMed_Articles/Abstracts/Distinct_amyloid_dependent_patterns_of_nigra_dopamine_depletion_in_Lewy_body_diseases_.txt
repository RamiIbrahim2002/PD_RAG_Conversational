Title: Distinct amyloid-dependent patterns of nigra dopamine depletion in Lewy body diseases.
PMID: 37614472

Abstract:
Concomitant amyloid pathology is not uncommon and contributes to the clinical characteristics of Lewy body disease (LBD). We investigated the effect of amyloid on striatal<sup>18</sup>F-FP-CIT uptake patterns in LBD, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies.
