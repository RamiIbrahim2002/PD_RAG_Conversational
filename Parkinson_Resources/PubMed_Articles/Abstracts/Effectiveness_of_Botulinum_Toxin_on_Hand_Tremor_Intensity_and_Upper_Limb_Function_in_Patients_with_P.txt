PMID: 37637849

Abstract:
Hand tremor is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). Tremors may be resistant to drug treatments. Therefore, Botulinum toxin (BoNT) could be a good alternative. This study aimed to review and analyze studies on the efficacy and safety of BoNT injection in hand tremor intensity and upper limb function in patients with idiopathic PD.
