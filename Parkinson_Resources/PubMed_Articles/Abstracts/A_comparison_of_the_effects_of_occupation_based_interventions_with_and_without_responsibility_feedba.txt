Title: A comparison of the effects of occupation-based interventions with and without responsibility feedback and conventional interventions on participation in people with idiopathic Parkinson's disease: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PMID: 37749629

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with debilitating motor and non-motor symptoms which affect participation in meaningful occupations. Occupation-based interventions can improve participation in people with PD. Evidence for incorporating structured and intensive occupational therapy by considering the concept of responsibility is lacking for this population. This trial will compare the effects of occupation-based interventions with and without responsibility feedback and conventional interventions on participation in people with idiopathic PD.
