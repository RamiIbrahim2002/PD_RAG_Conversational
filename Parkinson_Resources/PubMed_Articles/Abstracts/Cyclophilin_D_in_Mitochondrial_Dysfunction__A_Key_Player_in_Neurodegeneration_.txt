Title: Cyclophilin D in Mitochondrial Dysfunction: A Key Player in Neurodegeneration?
PMID: 37627330

Abstract:
Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in numerous complex diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the "powerhouse of the cell" turns into the "factory of death" is an exciting yet challenging task that can unveil new therapeutic targets. The mitochondrial matrix protein CyPD is a peptidylprolyl <i>cis</i>-<i>trans</i> isomerase involved in the regulation of the permeability transition pore (mPTP). The mPTP is a multi-conductance channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane whose dysregulated opening can ultimately lead to cell death and whose involvement in pathology has been extensively documented over the past few decades. Moreover, several mPTP-independent CyPD interactions have been identified, indicating that CyPD could be involved in the fine regulation of several biochemical pathways. To further enrich the picture, CyPD undergoes several post-translational modifications that regulate both its activity and interaction with its clients. Here, we will dissect what is currently known about CyPD and critically review the most recent literature about its involvement in neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease, supporting the notion that CyPD could serve as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of such conditions. Notably, significant efforts have been made to develop CyPD-specific inhibitors, which hold promise for the treatment of such complex disorders.
