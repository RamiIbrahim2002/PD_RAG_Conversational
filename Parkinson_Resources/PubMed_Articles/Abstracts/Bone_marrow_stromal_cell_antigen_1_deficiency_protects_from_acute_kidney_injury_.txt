Title: Bone marrow stromal cell antigen-1 deficiency protects from acute kidney injury.
PMID: 37969103

Abstract:
This study aimed to investigate the role of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-1 (Bst1; also known as CD157) in acute kidney injury (AKI). Bst1 is a cell surface molecule with various enzymatic activities and downstream intracellular signaling pathways that modulate the immune response. Previous research has linked Bst1 to diseases such as ovarian cancer, Parkinson's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. We used bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) as an AKI model and created bone marrow chimeric mice to evaluate the role of Bst1 in bone marrow-derived cells. We also used flow cytometry to identify Bst1/CD157 expression in hematopoietic cells and evaluate immune cell dynamics in the kidney. The findings showed that Bst1-deficient (<i>Bst1<sup>-/-</sup></i>) mice were protected against renal bilateral IRI. Bone marrow chimera experiments revealed that Bst1 expression on hematopoietic cells, but not parenchymal cells, induced renal IRI. Bst1 was mainly found in B cells and neutrophils by flow cytometry of the spleen and bone marrow. In vitro, migration of neutrophils from <i>Bst1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice was suppressed, and adoptive transfer of neutrophils from wild-type <i>Bst1</i><sup>+/+</sup> mice abolished the renal protective effect in <i>Bst1</i> knockout mice. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that <i>Bst1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice are protected against renal IRI and that Bst1 expression in neutrophils plays a crucial role in inducing renal IRI. These findings suggest that targeting Bst1 in neutrophils could be a potential therapeutic strategy for AKI.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Acute kidney injury (AKI), a serious disease for which there is no effective Federal Drug Administration-approved treatment, is associated with high mortality rates. Bone marrow stromal cell antigen-1 (Bst1) is a cell surface molecule that can cause kidney fibrosis, but its role in AKI is largely unknown. Our study showed that <i>Bst1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice revealed a protective effect against renal bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Adoptive transfer studies confirmed that Bst1 expression in hematopoietic cells, especially neutrophils, contributed to renal bilateral IRI.
