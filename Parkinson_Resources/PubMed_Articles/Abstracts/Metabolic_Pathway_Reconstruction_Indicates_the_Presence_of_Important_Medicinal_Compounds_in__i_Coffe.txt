Abstract:
The use of transcriptomic data to make inferences about plant metabolomes is a useful tool to help the discovery of important compounds in the available biodiversity. To unveil previously undiscovered metabolites of <i>Coffea</i>, of phytotherapeutic and economic value, we employed 24 RNAseq libraries. These libraries were sequenced from leaves exposed to a diverse range of environmental conditions. Subsequently, the data were meticulously processed to create models of putative metabolic networks, which shed light on the production of potential natural compounds of significant interest. Then, we selected one of the predicted compounds, the L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), to be analyzed by LC-MS/MS using three biological replicates of flowers, leaves, and fruits from <i>Coffea arabica</i> and <i>Coffea canephora.</i> We were able to identify metabolic pathways responsible for producing several compounds of economic importance. One of the identified pathways involved in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis was found to be active and producing L-DOPA, which is a common product of POLYPHENOL OXIDASES (PPOs, EC 1.14.18.1 and EC 1.10.3.1). We show that coffee plants are a natural source of L-DOPA, a widely used medicine for treatment of the human neurodegenerative condition called Parkinson's disease. In addition, dozens of other compounds with medicinal significance were predicted as potential natural coffee products. By further refining analytical chemistry techniques, it will be possible to enhance the characterization of coffee metabolites, enabling a deeper understanding of their properties and potential applications in medicine.
