PMID: 37404918

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder associated with heterogeneous symptoms. Though it is characterized by means of four distinct motor symptoms such as resting tremors, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. These patients also have deficits in fine motor skills while performing simple tasks such as brushing their own teeth, taking bath, remembering small details, and writing skills. The study aimed to qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of Yoga therapy in teaching oral hygiene practice and subsequently, on tooth brushing skills in patients who were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.
