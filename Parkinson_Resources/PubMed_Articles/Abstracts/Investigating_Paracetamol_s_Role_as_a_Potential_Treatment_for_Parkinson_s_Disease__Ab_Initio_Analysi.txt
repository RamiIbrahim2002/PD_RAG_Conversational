Title: Investigating Paracetamol's Role as a Potential Treatment for Parkinson's Disease: Ab Initio Analysis of Dopamine, l-DOPA, Paracetamol, and NAPQI Interactions with Enzymes Involved in Dopamine Metabolism.
PMID: 37867718

Abstract:
Recently, it was found that paracetamol can extend the therapeutic window of l-DOPA treatment for Parkinson's disease [Golding (2019) BJPharm, 4(2), Article 619]. It has been posited that the effect could be due to paracetamol and its metabolite, NAPQI, inhibiting pain signals in the spinal column. In this work, we examine the possibility that the therapeutic effect of the paracetamol for the Parkinson's disease patient may be due to an inhibition of the enzymes that metabolize dopamine and/or l-DOPA, thus effectively extending the lifetime of the l-DOPA treatment. In this work, we use the M062<i>X</i>/6-311+G* level of theory to calculate the electronic binding energies (including explicit desolvation) of several ligands (paracetamol, NAPQI, dopamine, and l-DOPA) with a series of enzymes important to the production and metabolism of dopamine and compare them to calculated binding energy values for the natural substrates for those enzymes in order to predict possible inhibition. Benchmark interaction energies for a subset of the systems studied are calculated using the more accurate second-order MÃ¸ller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) method in order to calibrate the accuracy of the M062X method. If we assume that the interaction energies calculated here can serve as a proxy for in vivo inhibition, then we can predict that paracetamol and NAPQI should not inhibit the natural production of dopamine and may in fact inhibit the metabolism of l-DOPA and dopamine, thus extending the length of l-DOPA treatments.
