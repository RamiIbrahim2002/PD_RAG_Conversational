Title: Emerging drugs for dementia with Lewy Bodies: a review of Phase II & III trials.
PMID: 37531299

Abstract:
Despite faster cognitive decline and greater negative impact on patients and family caregivers, drug development efforts in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) fall behind those for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Current off-label drug DLB treatment options are limited to symptomatic agents developed to address cognitive deficits in AD, motor deficits in Parkinson's Disease, or behavioral symptoms in psychiatric disease. Aided by recent improvements in DLB diagnosis, a new focus on the development of disease-modifying agents (DMA) is emerging.
