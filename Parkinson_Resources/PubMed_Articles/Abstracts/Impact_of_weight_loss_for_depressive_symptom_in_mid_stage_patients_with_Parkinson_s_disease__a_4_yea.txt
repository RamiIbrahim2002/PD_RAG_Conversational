PMID: 38249744

Abstract:
Weight loss is one of the non-motor symptoms frequently seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). Weight loss in PwPD is known to be negatively associated with motor and other non-motor symptoms and has been shown to influence the prognosis of PD. In this study, we followed weight change over a 4-year period in PwPD at a single institution and investigated the relationship between weight change and patients' motor and non-motor symptoms.
