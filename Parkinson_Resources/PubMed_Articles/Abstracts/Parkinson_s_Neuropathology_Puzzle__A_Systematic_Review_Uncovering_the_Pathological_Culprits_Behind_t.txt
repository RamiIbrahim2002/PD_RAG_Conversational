Title: Parkinson's Neuropathology Puzzle: A Systematic Review Uncovering the Pathological Culprits Behind the Neurological Disease.
PMID: 37664277

Abstract:
Being one of the most prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disorders (falling second only to Alzheimer's disease) with a clinical pattern affecting millions of lives all over the world, Parkinson's disease (PD) has never failed to attract a formidable interest from the vast majority of neurologists and researchers worldwide. This review article will analyze the pathophysiology, etiology, genetics, and pathological stages of Parkinson's disease with their corresponding clinical sequels. A review article was conducted using research databases including PubMed, PubMed Central, Springer, and Elsevier. The research articles reviewed using databases were written in English, German, Japanese, and Chinese and published within the preceding 50 years. Based on the article's findings, we concluded that Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder with a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms that are influenced by a cascade of pathological neuronal abnormalities such as Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies that gradually build up with an eventual consequence of neurodegeneration of dopamine-secreting neurons. Multiple genetic mutations, pathophysiological events, and environmental factors act as the foundation to initiate that cascade.
