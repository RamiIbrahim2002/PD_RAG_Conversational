Title: Oscillometry of the respiratory system in Parkinson's disease: physiological changes and diagnostic use.
PMID: 37884922

Abstract:
Lung function analysis in Parkinson's disease (PD) is often difficult due to the demand for adequate forced expiratory maneuvers. Respiratory oscillometry exams require onlyquiet tidal breathing and provide a detailed analysis of respiratory mechanics. We hypothesized that oscillometry would simplify the diagnosis of respiratory abnormalitiesin PD and improve our knowledge about the pathophysiological changes in these patients.
