Title: Staying hidden: The burden of stigma in PD.
PMID: 37689498

Abstract:
Despite the myriad motor and non-motor challenges associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis, the hidden issue of stigma may be among the most influential factors negatively affecting quality of life. A number of qualitative studies have been published assessing various aspects of stigma in PD, and quantitative studies assert that most people with PD experience stigma during the course of their disease. Stigma is associated with poorer mental and physical health, poorer quality of life, decreased levels of hope, self-esteem and self-efficacy. The resulting stigma can lead to social anxiety and isolation, reluctance to seek medical care, loneliness, depression and anxiety. Therefore, understanding what stigma is, where it comes from, and how it affects people living with PD may offer clinicians and care partners tools to help mitigate the negative effects.
