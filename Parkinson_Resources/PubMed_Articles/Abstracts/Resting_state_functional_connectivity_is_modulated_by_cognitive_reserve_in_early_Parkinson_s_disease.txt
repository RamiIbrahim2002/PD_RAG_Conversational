Title: Resting-state functional connectivity is modulated by cognitive reserve in early Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37691780

Abstract:
Fronto-striatal disconnection is thought to be at the basis of dysexecutive symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Multiple reserve-related processes may offer resilience against functional decline. Among these, cognitive reserve (CR) refers to the adaptability of cognitive processes.
