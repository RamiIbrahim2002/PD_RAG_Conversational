Title: Developing a Staging Scheme for Essential Tremor: A Discussion of Organizing Principles.
PMID: 37954035

Abstract:
Essential tremor (ET) is a chronic, progressive neurological disease that may negatively affect patients' lives. While there has been considerable progress in ET research, some fundamental issues remain unaddressed. One such issue is <i>disease staging</i>. Staging schemes have inherent value and are part of the dialogue that clinicians have with other movement disorders patients. We highlight the value of and challenges with developing a staging system for ET and organize a discussion around the potential steps in developing such a system. Diseases for which there are staging schemes generally have a number of shared characteristics. ET has numerous features that would lend themselves to a staging scheme: emerging evidence supporting the existence of a premotor phase of disease, insidious onset, progressive worsening of arm tremor, spread of tremor to other body regions, the observation that patients seem to be at increased risk for other conditions within the same organ (i.e., emergence of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease in excessive numbers of ET patients), pathological changes in the cerebellum whose evolution can be ordered from (i) those that compromise the physical integrity and physiological function of Purkinje cells, (ii) subsequent changes that are reparative and regenerative, and (iii) eventual cell death. Challenges to formulating a staging scheme are the absence of both a biological marker and an "end stage" of disease. The sum of combined evidence suggests that a staging scheme would be of value. We provide initial thoughts as to how to begin to structure such a staging scheme.
