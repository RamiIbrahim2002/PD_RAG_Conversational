Title: The outcomes of proximal femur replacement with hemiarthroplasty after tumor resection in individuals with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37901304

Abstract:
Patients with neurological disorders often experience a high incidence of postoperative complications following proximal femur replacement (PFR) surgery. The orthopaedist faces a significant difficulty in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) because of the weakened bone condition, excessive muscle tension, and increased risk of fractures. The objective of this research is to assess the impact of PD on PFR following tumor removal.
