Title: The High Value of External Anal- and Urethral-Sphincter Electromyography in Differential Diagnosis with MSA-P, PD, and PSP.
PMID: 37538423

Abstract:
It is a challenge to differentiate multiple system atrophy parkinsonism (MSA-P), Parkinson's disease (PD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). We aimed to explore the value of external anal-sphincter electromyography (EAS-EMG) and urethral-sphincter electromyography (US-EMG) in differential diagnosis with MSA-P, PD, and PSP.
