Title: Automated mechanical peripheral stimulation for gait rehabilitation in Parkinson's disease: A comprehensive review.
PMID: 37780489

Abstract:
Automated Mechanical Peripheral Stimulation (AMPS) has emerged as a potential rehabilitative intervention for gait abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the long-term effects and combined therapy with physical exercise remain unclear. This review aimed to explore the effects of automated mechanical peripheral stimulation (AMPS) on gait and motor performance in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).
