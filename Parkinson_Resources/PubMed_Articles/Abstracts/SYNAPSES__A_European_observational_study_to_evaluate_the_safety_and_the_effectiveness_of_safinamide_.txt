PMID: 37752685

Abstract:
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative condition requiring new therapeutic alternatives. Safinamide, a novel levodopa add-on therapy, positively affects disease fluctuations by modulating both dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. To further investigate the use of safinamide in European routine clinical practice, the present post-hoc analysis aimed to understand safinamide's safety profile within the Spanish study population.
