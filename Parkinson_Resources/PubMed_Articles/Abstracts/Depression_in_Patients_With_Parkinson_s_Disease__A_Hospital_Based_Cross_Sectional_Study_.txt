Title: Depression in Patients With Parkinson's Disease: A Hospital-Based Cross-Sectional Study.
PMID: 38022066

Abstract:
Depression, a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), is often underdiagnosed and can significantly impact the quality of life (QOL) and treatment outcomes. Specific disease-related factors and non-specific factors may contribute to depression, and these factors should be identified early to plan the appropriate interventions that promote positive mood. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression in PD patients and to find out the factors associated with depression among patients with PD attending the neurology OPD of a tertiary care teaching hospital in Trivandrum.
