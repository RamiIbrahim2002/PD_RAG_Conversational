Title: Ferritin Is Secreted from Primary Cultured Astrocyte in Response to Iron Treatment via TRPML1-Mediated Exocytosis.

Abstract:
Impaired iron homeostasis has been proven to be one of the critical contributors to the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Ferritin is considered an intracellular protein responsible for storing cytosolic iron. Recent studies have found that ferritin can be secreted from cells independent of the classical endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi system. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the secretion of ferritin in the brain were not elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated that the primary cultured astrocytes do have the ability to secrete ferritin, which is enhanced by iron treatment. Increased ferritin secretion was accompanied by increased protein expression of ferritin response to iron stimulation. Further study showed that iron-induced expression and secretion of ferritin could be inhibited by CQ or 3-MA pretreatment. In addition, the knockdown of transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) antagonized iron-induced ferritin secretion, accompanied by further increased intracellular protein levels of ferritin. Further study demonstrated that ferritin colocalized with LAMP1 in iron-treated astrocytes. On the contrary, ras-associated protein 27a (Rab27a) knockdown further enhanced iron-induced ferritin secretion and decreased intracellular protein levels of ferritin. Furthermore, we also showed that the secretory autophagy protein tripartite motif containing 16 (TRIM16) and sec22b decreased in iron-treated astrocytes. These results suggested that astrocytes might secrete ferritin via TRPML1-mediated exocytosis. This provides new evidence for the mechanisms underlying the secretion of ferritin in primary cultured astrocytes under a high iron environment.
