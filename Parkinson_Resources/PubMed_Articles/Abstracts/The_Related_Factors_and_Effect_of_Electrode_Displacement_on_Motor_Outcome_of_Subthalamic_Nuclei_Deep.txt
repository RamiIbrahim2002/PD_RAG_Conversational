Title: The Related Factors and Effect of Electrode Displacement on Motor Outcome of Subthalamic Nuclei Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 38137630

Abstract:
Previous studies have revealed the existence of electrode displacement during subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). However, the effect of electrode displacement on treatment outcomes is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to analyze the related factors of electrode displacement and assess postoperative electrode displacement in relation to the motor outcomes of STN-DBS.
