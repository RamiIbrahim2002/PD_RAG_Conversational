PMID: 37449823

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive illness, and early diagnosis and treatment can help delay its progression. However, clinics still lack high-throughput, low-invasive, precise, and objective diagnostic strategies. Herein, the Au nanoparticles anchored porous perovskite oxide microrods (CTO@Au) with designed superior properties is developed to construct a high-throughput detection platform. Specifically, a single metabolic fingerprinting is obtained from only 30 nL of serum within seconds, enabling the rapid acquisition of 239 × 8 high-quality fingerprints in ≈ 2 h. AD is distinguish from health controls and Parkinson's disease with an area under the curve (AUC) of 1.000. Moreover, eight specific metabolites are identified as a biomarker panel, based on which precise diagnosis of AD is achieved, with an AUC of 1.000 in blind test. The possible relevant pathways and potential mechanism involved in these biomarkers are investigated and discussed. This work provides a high-performance platform for metabolic diagnostic analysis.
