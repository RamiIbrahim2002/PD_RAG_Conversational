Title: Mutational spectrum and clinical features of GBA1 variants in a Chinese cohort with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37658046

Abstract:
GBA1 variants are important risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). Most studies assessing GBA1-related PD risk have been performed in European-derived populations. Although the coding region of the GBA1 gene in the Chinese population has been analyzed, the sample sizes were not adequate. In this study, we aimed to investigate GBA1 variants in a large Chinese cohort of patients with PD and healthy control and explore the associated clinical characteristics. GBA1 variants in 4034 patients and 2931 control participants were investigated using whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing. The clinical features of patients were evaluated using several scales. Regression analysis, chi-square, and Fisher exact tests were used to analyze GBA1 variants and the clinical symptoms of different groups. We identified 104 variants, including 8 novel variants, expanding the spectrum of GBA1 variants. The frequency of GBA1 variants in patients with PD was 7.46%, higher than that in the control (1.81%) (P < 0.001, odds ratio [OR] = 4.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.26-5.89). Among patients, 176 (4.36%) had severe variants, 34 (0.84%) carried mild variants, three (0.07%) had risk variants, and 88 (2.18%) carried unknown variants. Our study, for the first time, found that p.G241R (P = 0.007, OR = 15.3, 95% CI: 1.25-261.1) and p.S310G (P = 0.005, OR = 4.86, 95% CI: 1.52-28.04) variants increased the risk of PD. Patients with GBA1 variants exhibited an earlier onset age and higher risk of probable rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder, olfactory dysfunction, depression, and autonomic dysfunction than patients without GBA1 variants.
