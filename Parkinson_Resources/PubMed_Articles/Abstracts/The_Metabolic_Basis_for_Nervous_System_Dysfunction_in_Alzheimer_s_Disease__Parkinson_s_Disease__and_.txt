Title: The Metabolic Basis for Nervous System Dysfunction in Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Huntington's Disease.
PMID: 37488757

Abstract:
Disorders of metabolism affect multiple systems throughout the body but may have the greatest impact on both central and peripheral nervous systems. Currently available treatments and behavior changes for disorders that include diabetes mellitus (DM) and nervous system diseases are limited and cannot reverse the disease burden. Greater access to healthcare and a longer lifespan have led to an increased prevalence of metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. In light of these challenges, innovative studies into the underlying disease pathways offer new treatment perspectives for Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Huntington's Disease. Metabolic disorders are intimately tied to neurodegenerative diseases and can lead to debilitating outcomes, such as multi-nervous system disease, susceptibility to viral pathogens, and long-term cognitive disability. Novel strategies that can robustly address metabolic disease and neurodegenerative disorders involve a careful consideration of cellular metabolism, programmed cell death pathways, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its associated pathways of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1), mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), growth factor signaling, and underlying risk factors such as the apolipoprotein E (APOE-Îµ4) gene. Yet, these complex pathways necessitate comprehensive understanding to achieve clinical outcomes that target disease susceptibility, onset, and progression.
