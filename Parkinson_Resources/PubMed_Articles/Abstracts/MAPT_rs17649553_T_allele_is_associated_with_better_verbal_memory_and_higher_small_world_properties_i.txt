Abstract:
Currently, over 90 genetic loci have been found to be associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) in genome-wide association studies, nevertheless, the effects of these genetic variants on the clinical features and brain structure of PD patients are largely unknown. This study investigated the effects of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) rs17649553 (C>T), a genetic variant associated with reduced PD risk, on the clinical manifestations and brain networks of PD patients. We found MAPT rs17649553 T allele was associated with better verbal memory in PD patients. In addition, MAPT rs17649553 significantly shaped the topology of gray matter covariance network and white matter network. Both the network metrics in gray matter covariance network and white matter network were correlated with verbal memory, however, the mediation analysis showed that it was the small-world properties in white matter network that mediated the effects of MAPT rs17649553 on verbal memory. These results suggest that MAPT rs17649553 T allele is associated with higher small-world properties in structural network and better verbal memory in PD.
