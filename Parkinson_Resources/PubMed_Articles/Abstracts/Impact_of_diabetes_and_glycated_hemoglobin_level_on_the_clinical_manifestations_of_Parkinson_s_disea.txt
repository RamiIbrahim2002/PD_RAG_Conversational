Title: Impact of diabetes and glycated hemoglobin level on the clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37931442

Abstract:
The coexistence of diabetes mellitus (DM) has been suggested to accelerate the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) and make the phenotype more severe. In this study, we investigated whether DM or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels affect the differences in motor and nonmotor symptoms.
