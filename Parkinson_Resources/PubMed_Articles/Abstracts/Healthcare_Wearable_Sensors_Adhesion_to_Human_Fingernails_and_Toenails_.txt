Title: Healthcare Wearable Sensors Adhesion to Human Fingernails and Toenails.
PMID: 38258188

Abstract:
A novel adhesion method of a sensor to a fingernail is described. Wearable sensors can provide health insights to humans for a wide variety of benefits, such as continuous wellness monitoring and disease monitoring throughout a patient's daily life. While there are many locations to place these wearable sensors on the body, we will focus on the fingertip, one significant way that people interact with the world. Like artificial fingernails used for aesthetics, wearable healthcare sensors can be attached to the fingernail for short or long time periods with minimal irritation and disruption to daily life. In this study the structure and methods of healthcare sensors' attachment and removal have been explored to support (1) the sensor functional requirements, (2) biological and environmentally compatible solutions and (3) ease of attachment and removal for short- and long-term user applications. Initial fingernail sensors were attached using a thin adhesive layer of commonly available cosmetic nail glue. While this approach allowed for easy application and strong adhesion to the nail, the removal could expose the fingernail and finger to a commercially available cosmetic nail removal (acetone-based chemical) for extended times measured in minutes. Therefore, a novel structure and method were developed for rapid healthcare sensor attachment and removal in seconds, which supported both the sensor functional objectives and the biologically and environmentally safe use objectives.
