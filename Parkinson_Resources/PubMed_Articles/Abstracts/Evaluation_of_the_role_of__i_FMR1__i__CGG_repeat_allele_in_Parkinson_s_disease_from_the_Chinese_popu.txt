Title: Evaluation of the role of <i>FMR1</i> CGG repeat allele in Parkinson's disease from the Chinese population.
PMID: 37583466

Abstract:
There is controversial evidence that <i>FMR1</i> premutation or "gray zone" (GZ) allele (small CGG expansion, 45-54 repeats) was associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to explore further the association between <i>FMR1</i> CGG repeat expansions and PD in a large sample of Chinese origin.
