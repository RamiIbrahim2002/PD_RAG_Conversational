PMID: 37408376

Abstract:
Group singing for people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is an established intervention not only to improve voice and speech difficulties but also for emotional and social benefit. Less is known about the experiences of group singing on the couple-the person with PD and their spouse or partner together-and studies have not specifically tracked impact through time or in combination with songwriting.
