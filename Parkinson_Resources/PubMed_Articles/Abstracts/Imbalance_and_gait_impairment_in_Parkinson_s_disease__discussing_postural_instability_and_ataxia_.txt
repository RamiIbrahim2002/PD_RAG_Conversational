Title: Imbalance and gait impairment in Parkinson's disease: discussing postural instability and ataxia.
PMID: 37985635

Abstract:
Gait and balance difficulties pose significant clinical challenges in Parkinson's disease (PD). The impairment of physiological mechanisms responsible for maintaining natural orthostatism plays a central role in the pathophysiology of postural instability observed in PD. In addition to the well-known rigidity and abnormalities in muscles and joints, various brain regions involved in the regulation of posture, balance, and gait, such as the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and brainstem regions like the pontine peduncle nucleus, are affected in individuals with PD. The recognition of the cerebellum's role in PD has been increasingly acknowledged. Cortical areas and their connections are associated with freezing of gait, a type of frontal lobe ataxia commonly observed in PD. Furthermore, impairments in the peripheral nervous system, including those caused by levodopatherapy, can contribute to gait impairment and imbalance in PD patients. Consequently, individuals with PD may exhibit frontal ataxia, sensory ataxia, and even cerebellar ataxia as underlying causes of gait disturbances and imbalance, starting from the early stages of the disease. The complex interplay between dysfunctional brain regions, impaired cortical connections, and peripheral nervous system abnormalities contributes to the multifaceted nature of gait and balance difficulties in PD. Understanding the intricate mechanisms is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic approaches targeting these specific deficits in PD.
