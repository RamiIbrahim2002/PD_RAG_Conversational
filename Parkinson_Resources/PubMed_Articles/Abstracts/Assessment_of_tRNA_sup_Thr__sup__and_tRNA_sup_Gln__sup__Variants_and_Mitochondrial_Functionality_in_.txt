Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is speculated with genetic and environmental factors. At molecular level, the mitochondrial impact is stated to be one of the causative reasons for PD. In this study, we investigated the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels along with mitochondrial tRNA alterations among three age categories of PD. By determining the genetic and organellar functionality using molecular techniques, the ROS levels were reported to be high with decreased MMP and ATP in the late-onset age group than in other two age categories. Likewise, the tRNA significancy in tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> and tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> was noticed with C4335T and G15927A mutations in late-onset and early-onset PD groups respectively. Therefore, from the findings, ageing has shown a disruption in tRNA metabolism leading to critical functioning of ATP synthesis and MMP, causing oxidative stress in PD patients. These physiological outcomes show that ageing has a keen role in the divergence of mitochondrial function, thereby proving a correlation with ageing and maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis in PD.
