Title: Ethics and regulation of neuronal optogenetics in the European Union.
PMID: 37996706

Abstract:
Neuronal optogenetics is a technique to control the activity of neurons with light. This is achieved by artificial expression of light-sensitive ion channels in the target cells. By optogenetic methods, cells that are naturally light-insensitive can be made photosensitive and addressable by illumination and precisely controllable in time and space. So far, optogenetics has primarily been a basic research tool to better understand the brain. However, initial studies are already investigating the possibility of using optogenetics in humans for future therapeutic approaches for neuronal based diseases such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, or to promote stroke recovery. In addition, optogenetic methods have already been successfully applied to a human in an experimental setting. Neuronal optogenetics also raises ethical and legal issues, e.g., in relation to, animal experiments, and its application in humans. Additional ethical and legal questions may arise when optogenetic methods are investigated on cerebral organoids. Thus, for the successful translation of optogenetics from basic research to medical practice, the ethical and legal questions of this technology must also be answered, because open ethical and legal questions can hamper the translation. The paper provides an overview of the ethical and legal issues raised by neuronal optogenetics. In addition, considering the technical prerequisites for translation, the paper shows consistent approaches to address these open questions. The paper also aims to support the interdisciplinary dialogue between scientists and physicians on the one hand, and ethicists and lawyers on the other, to enable an interdisciplinary coordinated realization of neuronal optogenetics.
