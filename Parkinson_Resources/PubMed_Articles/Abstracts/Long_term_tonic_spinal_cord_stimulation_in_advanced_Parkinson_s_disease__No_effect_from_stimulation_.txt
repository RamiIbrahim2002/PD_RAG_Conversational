PMID: 37854636

Abstract:
•Chronic spinal cord stimulation effectiveness was evaluated in four PD patients.•Double blinded cross over evaluation was performed using subthreshold stimulation.•An open label evaluation with regular suprathreshold stimulation was also performed.•No statistically significant effect was produced with either stimulation.•This study highlights the lack of strong clinical evidence supporting SCS for PD.
