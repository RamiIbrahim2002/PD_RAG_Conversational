Title: Strained face during sleep in multiple system atrophy: not just a bad dream.
PMID: 37463431

Abstract:
Patients with Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy may be subject to sleep state dissociation. Motivated by the fortuitous observation of prominent facial muscle activity during video-polysomnography in patients with multiple system atrophy, we assessed facial motor activity and chin muscle tone during sleep in multiple system atrophy compared to Parkinson's disease and controls.
