PMID: 38288279

Abstract:
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are both chronic, progressive disorders. As such, given the inconclusive results of extensive research on the association between IBD and PD, our study intends to examine this relationship further using the UK Biobank database.
