Title: Exploring the Therapeutic Effects of Multifunctional <i>N</i>-Salicylic Acid Tryptamine Derivative against Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37576637

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress play an important role in the whole course of PD, which have been the focus of PD drug development. In our previous research, a series of <i>N</i>-salicylic acid tryptamine derivatives were synthesized, and the biological evaluation showed that the compound <i>LZWL</i>02003 has good anti-neuroinflammatory activity and displayed great therapeutic potency for neurodegenerative disease models. In this work, the neuroprotective efficiency of <i>LZWL</i>02003 against PD <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> has been explored. It was found that <i>LZWL</i>02003 could protect human neuron cells SH-SY5Y from MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced neuronal damage by inhibiting ROS generation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular apoptosis. Moreover, <i>LZWL</i>02003 could improve cognition, memory, learning, and athletic ability in a rotenone-induced PD rat model. In general, our study has demonstrated that <i>LZWL</i>02003 has good activity against PD in <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments, which can potentially be developed into a therapeutic candidate for PD.
