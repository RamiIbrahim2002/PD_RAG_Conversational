Title: Detection of Parkinson's disease with keystroke data.
PMID: 37599616

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most widespread neurological disorders associated with nerve damage without definitive treatment. Impairments, such as trembling and slowing down in hand movements are among the first symptoms. For this purpose, in this study, machine learning (ML)-based models were developed by using keyboard keystroke dynamics. According to patients' drug use status, disease severity, and gender, we created 14 different sub-datasets and extracted 378 features using raw keystroke data. We developed alternative models with Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. We further used Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRmR), RELIEF, sequential forward selection (SFS), and RF feature selection methods to investigate prominent features in distinguishing PD. We developed ML models that jointly use the most popular features of selection algorithms (feature ensemble [FE]) and an ensemble classifier by combining multiple ML algorithms utilizing majority vote (model ensemble [ME]). With 14 different sets, FE and ME models provided accuracy (Acc.) in the range of 91.73 - 100% and 81.08 - 100%, respectively.
