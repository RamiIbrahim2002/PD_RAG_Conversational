Title: Mutant α-synuclein propagates via the lymphatic system of the brain in the monomeric state.
PMID: 37591248

Abstract:
Prion-like protein propagation is considered a common pathogenic mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases. Here we investigate the in vivo propagation pattern and aggregation state of mutant α-synuclein by injecting adeno-associated viral (AAV)-α-synuclein-A53T-EGFP into the mouse olfactory cortex. Comparison of aggregation states in various brain regions at multiple time points after injection using western blot analyses shows that the monomeric state of the mutant/misfolded protein propagates to remote brain regions by 2 weeks and that the propagated proteins aggregate in situ after being incorporated into neurons. Moreover, injection of Alexa 488-labeled α-synuclein-A53T confirms the monomeric propagation at 2 weeks. Super-resolution microscopy shows that both α-synuclein-A53T proteins propagate via the lymphatic system, penetrate perineuronal nets, and reach the surface of neurons. Electron microscopy shows that the propagated mutant/misfolded monomer forms fibrils characteristic of Parkinson's disease after its incorporation into neurons. These findings suggest a mode of propagation different from that of aggregate-dependent propagation.
