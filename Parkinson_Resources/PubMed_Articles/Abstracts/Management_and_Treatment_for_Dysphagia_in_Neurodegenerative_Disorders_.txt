Title: Management and Treatment for Dysphagia in Neurodegenerative Disorders.
PMID: 38202163

Abstract:
Patients with neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) often experience functional dysphagia, which may involve dysfunction in a specific phase of swallowing or in the entire process. This review outlines the approach to dysphagia in the setting of NDDs. Distinguishing the etiology of dysphagia can be difficult, and it is important to always look out for signs pointing to NDD as the cause. Thorough diagnostic work-up is essential, and it includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, alongside swallowing function tests, such as fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, videofluoroscopic swallowing study, and high-resolution manometry. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach with a treatment plan tailored to each patient. This involves dietary guidance, swallowing rehabilitation, and surgery in cases in which improvement with rehabilitation is inadequate. Surgery may involve altering certain pharyngolaryngeal structures to facilitate swallowing and reduce the risk of aspiration (swallowing improvement surgery) or separating the airway and digestive tract while sacrificing laryngeal function, with the main goal of preventing aspiration (aspiration prevention surgery). Proper management stems from recognizing the impact of these disorders on swallowing and consistently finding ways to improve the quality of life of patients.
