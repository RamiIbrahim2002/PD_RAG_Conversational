Abstract:
Several efforts to develop new protocols to differentiate in in vitro human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) into dopamine (DA) neurons have been reported. We have formulated NeuroForsk 2.0 medium containing fibroblast growth factor type beta (FGFb), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), melatonin, purmorphamine, and forskolin. We report for the first time that menstrual stromal cells (MenSCs) cultured in NeuroForsk 2.0 medium for 7 days transdifferentiated into DA-like neurons (DALNs) expressing specific DA lineage markers tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells (TH+) and DA transporter-positive (DAT+) cells and were responsive to DA-induced transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. To test the usefulness of this medium, DALNs were exposed to rotenone (ROT), a naturally occurring organic neurotoxin used extensively to chemically induce an in vitro model of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is a movement disorder characterized by the specific loss of DA neurons. We wanted to determine whether ROT induces apoptotic cell death and autophagy pathway under acute or chronic conditions in DALNs. Here, we report that acute ROT exposure induced several molecular changes in DALNS. ROT induced a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>), high expression of parkin (PRKN), and high colocalization of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) with the mitochondrial translocase of the outer membrane of mitochondria 20 (TOMM20) protein. Acute ROT also induced the appearance of DJ-1Cys<sup>106</sup>-SO<sub>3</sub>, as evidenced by the generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and oxidative stress (OS) damage. Remarkably, ROT triggered the phosphorylation of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) at residue Ser<sup>935</sup> and phosphorylation of α-Syn at residue Ser<sup>129</sup>, a pathological indicator. ROT induced the accumulation of lipidated microtubule-associated protein 1B-light chain 3 (LC3B), a highly specific marker of autophagosomes. Finally, ROT induced cleaved caspase 3 (CC3), a marker of activated caspase 3 (CASP3) in apoptotic DALNs compared to untreated DANLs. However, the chronic condition was better at inducing the accumulation of lysosomes than the acute condition. Importantly, the inhibitor of the LRRK2 kinase PF-06447475 (PF-475) almost completely blunted ROT-induced apoptosis and reduced ROT-induced accumulation of lysosomes in both acute and chronic conditions in DALNs. Our data suggest that LRRK2 kinase regulated both apoptotic cell death and autophagy in DALNs under OS. Given that defects in mitochondrial complex I activity are commonly observed in PD, ROT works well as a chemical model of PD in both acute and chronic conditions. Therefore, prevention and treatment therapy should be guided to relieve DALNs from mitochondrial damage and OS, two of the most important triggers in the apoptotic cell death of DALNs.
