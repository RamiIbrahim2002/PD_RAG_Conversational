Title: Upregulation of the parietal cortex improves freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37633012

Abstract:
BACKGROUND The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a key brain area for visuospatial processing and locomotion. It has been repetitively shown to be involved in the neural correlates of freezing of gait (FOG), a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, current neuroimaging modalities do not allow to precisely determine the role of the PPC during real FOG episodes. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to modulate the PPC cortical excitability using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to determine whether the PPC contributes to FOG or compensates for dysfunctional neural networks to reduce FOG. METHODS Fourteen participants with PD who experience freezing took part in a proof of principle study consisting of three experimental sessions targeting the PPC with inhibitory, excitatory, and sham rTMS. Objective FOG outcomes and cortical excitability measurements were acquired before and after each stimulation protocol. RESULTS Increasing PPC excitability resulted in significantly fewer freezing episodes and percent time frozen during a FOG-provoking task. This reduction in FOG most likely emerged from the trend in PPC inhibiting the lower leg motor cortex excitability. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that the recruitment of the PPC is linked to less FOG, providing support for the beneficial role of the PPC upregulation in preventing FOG. This could potentially be linked to a reduction of the cortical input burden on the basal ganglia prior to FOG. Excitatory rTMS interventions targeting the PPC may have the potential to reduce FOG.
