Title: A Novel Brain PET Radiotracer for Imaging Alpha Synuclein Fibrils in Multiple System Atrophy.
PMID: 37651366

Abstract:
Abnormal α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation characterizes α-synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). However, no suitable positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for imaging α-syn in PD and MSA exists currently. Our structure-activity relationship studies identified 4-methoxy-<i>N</i>-(4-(3-(pyridin-2-yl)-3,8-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-yl)phenyl)benzamide (<b>4i</b>) as a PET radiotracer candidate for imaging α-syn. <i>In vitro</i> assays revealed high binding of <b>4i</b> to recombinant α-syn fibrils (inhibition constant (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub>) = 6.1 nM) and low affinity for amyloid beta (Aβ) fibrils in Alzheimer's disease (AD) homogenates. However, <b>[</b><sup><b>3</b></sup><b>H]4i</b> also exhibited high specific binding to AD, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration tissues as well as PD and MSA tissues, suggesting notable affinity to tau. Nevertheless, the specific binding to pathologic α-syn aggregates in MSA post-mortem brain tissues was significantly higher than in PD tissues. This finding demonstrated the potential use of <b>[</b><sup><b>11</b></sup><b>C]4i</b> as a PET tracer for imaging α-syn in MSA patients. Nonhuman primate PET studies confirmed good brain uptake and rapid washout for <b>[</b><sup><b>11</b></sup><b>C]4i</b>.
