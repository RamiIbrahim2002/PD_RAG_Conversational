Title: Inflammatory Blood Biomarkers Are Associated with Long-Term Clinical Disease Severity in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37834363

Abstract:
An altered immune response has been identified as a pathophysiological factor in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to identify blood immunity-associated proteins that discriminate PD from controls and that are associated with long-term disease severity in PD patients. Immune response-derived proteins in blood plasma were measured using Proximity Extension Technology by OLINK in a cohort of PD patients (N = 66) and age-matched healthy controls (N = 52). In a selection of 30 PD patients, we evaluated changes in protein levels 7-10 years after the baseline and assessed correlations with motor and cognitive assessments. Data from the Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) cohort and the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort were used for independent validation. PD patients showed an altered immune response compared to controls based on a panel of four proteins (IL-12B, OPG, CXCL11, and CSF-1). The expression levels of five inflammation-associated proteins (CCL23, CCL25, TNFRSF9, TGF-alpha, and VEGFA) increased over time in PD and were partially associated with more severe motor and cognitive symptoms at follow-up. Increased CCL23 levels were associated with cognitive decline and the <i>APOE4</i> genotype. Our findings provide further evidence for an altered immune response in PD that is associated with disease severity in PD over a long period of time.
