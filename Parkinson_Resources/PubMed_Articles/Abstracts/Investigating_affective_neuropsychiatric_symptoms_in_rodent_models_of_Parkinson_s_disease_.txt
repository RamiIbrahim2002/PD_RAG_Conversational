Title: Investigating affective neuropsychiatric symptoms in rodent models of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38341228

Abstract:
Affective neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety and apathy are among the most frequent non-motor symptoms observed in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). These conditions often emerge during the prodromal phase of the disease and are generally considered to result from neurodegenerative processes in meso-corticolimbic structures, occurring in parallel to the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Depression, anxiety, and apathy are often treated with conventional medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and dopaminergic agonists. The ability of these pharmacological interventions to consistently counteract such neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD is still relatively limited and the development of reliable experimental models represents an important tool to identify more effective treatments. This chapter provides information on rodent models of PD utilized to study these affective neuropsychiatric symptoms. Neurotoxin-based and genetic models are discussed, together with the main behavioral tests utilized to identify depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, anhedonia, and apathy. The ability of various therapeutic approaches to counteract the symptoms observed in the various models is also reviewed.
