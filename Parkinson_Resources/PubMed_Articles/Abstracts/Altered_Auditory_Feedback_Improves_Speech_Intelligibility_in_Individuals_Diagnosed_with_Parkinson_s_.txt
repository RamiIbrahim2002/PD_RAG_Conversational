Title: Altered Auditory Feedback Improves Speech Intelligibility in Individuals Diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease: A Pilot Study.
PMID: 38035551

Abstract:
The purpose of the current study was to evaluate speech intelligibility and speech rate in individuals with Parkinson's disease using altered auditory feedback (AAF) in comparison to age-matched healthy controls. Based on prior research, it is hypothesized that the use of AAF will improve participants' speech intelligibility.
