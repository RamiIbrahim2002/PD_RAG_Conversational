Title: Oral and Transdermal Rivastigmine for the Treatment of Anticholinergic Delirium: A Case Report.
PMID: 37716903

Abstract:
Anticholinergic toxicity is a common cause of delirium in emergency department patients. The standard antidotal treatment for anticholinergic toxicity is physostigmine. Physostigmine functions as a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Rivastigmine is another member of this class currently approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Rivastigmine also crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been found to be effective in the management of anticholinergic toxicity in limited case reports.
