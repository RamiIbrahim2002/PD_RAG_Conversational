Title: Unlocking the Therapeutic Potential of Ulotaront as a Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 Agonist for Neuropsychiatric Disorders.
PMID: 37509616

Abstract:
All antipsychotics currently used in clinic block D2 dopamine receptors. Trace amine-associated receptor 1 is emerging as a new therapeutic target for schizophrenia and several other neuropsychiatric disorders. SEP-363856 (International Nonproprietary Name: Ulotaront) is an investigational antipsychotic drug with a novel mechanism of action that does not involve antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors. Ulotaront is an agonist of trace amine-associated receptor 1 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, but can modulate dopamine neurotransmission indirectly. In 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for ulotaront for the treatment of schizophrenia. Phase 2 clinical studies indicated that ulotaront can reduce both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia without causing the extrapyramidal or metabolic side effects that are inherent to most currently used antipsychotics. At present, it is in phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of schizophrenia and is expected to be introduced into clinical practice in 2023-2024. Clinical studies evaluating the potential efficacy of ulotaront in Parkinson's disease psychosis, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder have also been started. The aim of this scoping review is to summarize all currently available preclinical and clinical evidence on the utility of ulotaront in the treatment of schizophrenia. Here, we show the main characteristics and distinctive features of this drug. Perspectives and limitations on the potential use of ulotaront in the pharmacotherapy of several other neuropsychiatric disorders are also discussed.
