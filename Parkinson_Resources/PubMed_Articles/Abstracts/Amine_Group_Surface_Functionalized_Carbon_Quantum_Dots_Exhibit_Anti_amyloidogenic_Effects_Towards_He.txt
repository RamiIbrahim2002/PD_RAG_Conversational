Title: Amine Group Surface-Functionalized Carbon Quantum Dots Exhibit Anti-amyloidogenic Effects Towards Hen Egg White Lysozyme by Inducing Formation of Nontoxic Spherical Aggregates.
PMID: 37803220

Abstract:
The tendency of polypeptide chains to deviate from their conventional protein folding pathway and instead get trapped as off-pathway intermediates, has been a matter of great concern. These off-pathway intermediates eventually lead to the formation of insoluble, ordered fibrillar aggregates called amyloids, which are responsible for a host of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Type II diabetes. In spite of extensive research, development of an effective therapeutic strategy against amyloidosis still remains elusive. In recent times, carbon quantum dots (CQD) have grabbed the attention of researchers against amyloidogenesis due to their ease of preparation, aqueous soluble nature, unique optical properties, high surface to volume ratio, physio-chemical properties, semi-conducting nature and mainly biocompatible. In the current study, we have reported an easy-to-prepare procedure for synthesis of amine group surface functionalized CQDs from commonly available kitchen spices with anti-oxidant properties. The as-synthesized CQDs were evaluated for their anti-amyloidogenic properties towards Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL). Our results clearly show that the surfaced functionalized CQDs were able to interact with HEWL, thereby forming a stable complex, which was resistant towards amyloid formation and instead lead to the formation of non-toxic globular aggregates.
