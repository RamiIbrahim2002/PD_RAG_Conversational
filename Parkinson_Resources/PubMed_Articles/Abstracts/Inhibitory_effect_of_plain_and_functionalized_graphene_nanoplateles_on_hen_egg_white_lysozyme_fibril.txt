Title: Inhibitory effect of plain and functionalized graphene nanoplateles on hen egg white lysozyme fibrillation.
PMID: 37542838

Abstract:
Protein fibrillation is a phenomenon associated with misfolding and the production of highly ordered nanofibrils, which may cause serious degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and type 2 diabetes. Upon contact with biological fluids, the nanomaterials are immediately covered by proteins and interact with them. In this study, the effects of Graphene NanoPlateles (Plain-GNPs) and their modified forms with a carboxyl group (GNPs -COOH) and an amine group (GNPs -NH<sub>2</sub>) are evaluated on the fibrillation process of Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL). The fibrillation process of HEWL was studied using thioflavin-T, Circular Dichroism spectrometry, and Atomic Force Microscopy. Plain-GNPs significantly decreased the fibrillation process at different stages, including nucleation, exponential fibrillation phases, and end-mature fibril products. However, GNPs-COOH and GNPs-NH<sub>2</sub> affected the final fluorescence of ThT. The species formed in the presence of Plain-GNPs showed less toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, which could be applicable for therapeutic purposes.
