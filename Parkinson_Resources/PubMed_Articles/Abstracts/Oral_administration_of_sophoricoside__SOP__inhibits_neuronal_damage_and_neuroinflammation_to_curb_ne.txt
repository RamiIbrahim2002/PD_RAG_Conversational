Title: Oral administration of sophoricoside (SOP) inhibits neuronal damage and neuroinflammation to curb neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.

Abstract:
Neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation are key factors involved in the pathological changes of Parkinson's disease (PD). Sophoricoside (SOP) has shown anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis effects in various diseases. However, the role of SOP in PD has not been reported. In this experiment, we found that oral administration of SOP alleviated weight loss and motor symptoms in 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-injected mice. Further studies revealed that SOP inhibited inflammatory responses and neuronal apoptosis in the midbrain region of MPTP-injected mice. In vitro mechanistic study, we found that SOP exerts neuroprotective effects through a two-sided action. On the one hand, SOP inhibits Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in microglia by inhibiting the Nuclear factor kappa-B(NF-ÎºB) pathway. On the other hand, SOP inhibits 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>)-induced neuronal apoptosis by regulating the Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Thus SOP is expected to be a potential therapeutic agent for PD by targeting neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis.
