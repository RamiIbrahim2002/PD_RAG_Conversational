Title: Nature of Parkinsonian features in multiple system atrophy.
PMID: 38746510

Abstract:
For this observational study, we evaluated the clinical profile of Parkinsonian features in multiple system atrophy (MSA), as there is no clarity about the specifics of these features in this disease compared to progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Parkinson's disease (PD).
