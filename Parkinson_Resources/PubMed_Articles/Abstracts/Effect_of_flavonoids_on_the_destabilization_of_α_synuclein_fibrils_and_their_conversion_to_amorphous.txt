PMID: 37574034

Abstract:
The second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), is caused by the accumulation and deposition of fibrillar aggregates of the α-Syn into the Lewy bodies. To create a potent pharmacological candidate to destabilize the preformed α-Syn fibril, it is important to understand the precise molecular mechanism underlying the destabilization of the α-Syn fibril. Through molecular dynamics simulations and experiments, we have examined the molecular mechanisms causing the destabilization and suppression of a newly discovered α-Syn fibril with a Greek-key-like shape and an aggregation prone state (APS) of α-Syn in the presence and absence of various Flvs. According to MD simulation and experimental evidence, morin, quercetin, and myricetin are the Flvs, most capable of destabilizing the fibrils and converting them into amorphous aggregates. Compared to galangin and kaempferol, they have more hydroxyl groups and form more hydrogen bonds with fibrils.The processes by which morin and myricetin prevent new fibril production from APS and destabilize the fibrils are different. According to linear interaction energy analysis, van der Waals interaction predominates with morin, and electrostatic interaction dominates with myricetin. Our MD simulation and experimental findings provide mechanistic insights into how Flvs destabilize α-Syn fibrils and change their morphology, opening the door to developing structure-based drugs for treating Parkinson's disease.
