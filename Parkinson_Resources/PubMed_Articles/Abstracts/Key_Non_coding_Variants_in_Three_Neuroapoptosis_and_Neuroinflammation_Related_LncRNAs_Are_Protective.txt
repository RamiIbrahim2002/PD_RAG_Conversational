PMID: 37946005

Abstract:
Research findings show that genetic susceptibility to sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), a common neurodegenerative disorder, is determined through gene variation of loci involved in its development and pathogenesis. A growing body of strong evidence has revealed that dysfunction of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) plays key roles in the pathogenesis and progression of PD through impairing neuronal signaling pathways, but little is known about the relationship between their variants and PD susceptibility. In this research, we intended to study the relationship between functional SNPs rs12826786C>T, rs3200401C>T, and rs6931097G>A in the key lncRNAs stimulating neuroapoptosis and neuroinflammation in PD, including HOTAIR, MALAT1, and lincRNA-P21, respectively, with susceptibility to PD as well as its clinical symptoms.The population of this study consisted of 240 individuals, including 120 controls and 120 cases, and the sample taken from them was peripheral blood. Genotyping of the target SNPs was done using PCR-RFLP. We found that the healthy individuals carry more T allele of MALAT1-rs3200401C>T compared to the patients (P= 0.019). Furthermore, it was observed that in the dominant genetic model, subjects with genotypes carrying the T allele have a lower risk of PD (OR= 0.530; CI= 0.296-0.950; P= 0.033). Regarding the lincRNA-P21-rs6931097G>A, we observed a significant protective relationship between its GA (OR= 0.144; CI= 0.030-0.680; P= 0.014) and AA (OR= 0.195; CI= 00.047-0.799; P= 0.023) genotypes with the manifestation of tremor and bradykinesia symptoms, respectively. Furthermore, the findings indicated that the minor TT genotype of HOTAIR-rs12826786C>T was significantly associated with a reduced risk of bradykinesia symptoms (OR= 0.147; CI= 0.039-0.555; P= 0.005). Collectively, these findings suggest that MALAT1-rs3200401C>T may be an important lncRNA SNP against the development of PD, while the other two SNPs show protective effects on the clinical manifestations of PD in a way that lincRNA-P21-rs6931097G>A has a protective effect against the occurrence of tremor and bradykinesia symptoms in PD patients, and HOTAIR -rs12826786C>T indicates a protective effect against the display of bradykinesia feature. Therefore, they can have valuable potential as biomarkers for clinical evaluations of this disease.
