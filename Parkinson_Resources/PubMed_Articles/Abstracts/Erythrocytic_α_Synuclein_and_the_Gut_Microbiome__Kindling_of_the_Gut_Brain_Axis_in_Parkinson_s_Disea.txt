Title: Erythrocytic α-Synuclein and the Gut Microbiome: Kindling of the Gut-Brain Axis in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37798868

Abstract:
Progressive spreading of α-synuclein via gut-brain axis has been hypothesized in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the source of seeding-capable α-synuclein in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) has not been fully investigated. Additionally, the mechanism by which the GIT microbiome contributes to PD pathogenesis remains to be characterized.
