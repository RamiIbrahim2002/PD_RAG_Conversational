Title: The impact of Parkinson's disease-associated gut microbiota on the transcriptome in <i>Drosophila</i>.
PMID: 37754772

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in middle-aged and elderly people, and many studies have confirmed that the disorder of gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiological process of PD. However, the molecular mechanism of gut microbiota in regulating the pathogenesis of PD is still lacking. In this study, to investigate the impact of PD-associated gut microbiota on host transcriptome, we established various PD models with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the model organism <i>Drosophila</i> followed by integrative data analysis of microbiome and transcriptome. We first constructed rotenone-induced PD models in <i>Drosophila</i> followed by FMT in different groups. Microbial analysis by 16S rDNA sequencing showed that gut microbiota from PD <i>Drosophila</i> could affect bacterial structure of normal <i>Drosophila</i>, and gut microbiota from normal <i>Drosophila</i> could affect bacterial structure of PD <i>Drosophila</i>. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PD-associated gut microbiota influenced expression patterns of genes enriched in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, lysosome, and diverse metabolic pathways. Importantly, to verify our findings, we transplanted <i>Drosophila</i> with fecal samples from clinical PD patients. Compared to the control, <i>Drosophila</i> transplanted with fecal samples from PD patients had reduced microbiota <i>Acetobacter</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and differentially expressed genes enriched in diverse metabolic pathways. In summary, our results reveal the influence of PD-associated gut microbiota on host gene expression, and this study can help better understand the link between gut microbiota and PD pathogenesis through gut-brain axis. IMPORTANCE Gut microbiota plays important roles in regulating host gene expression and physiology through complex mechanisms. Recently, it has been suggested that disorder of gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiological process of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the molecular mechanism of gut microbiota in regulating the pathogenesis of PD is still lacking. In this study, to investigate the impact of PD-associated gut microbiota on host transcriptome, we established various PD models with fecal microbiota transplantation in the model organism <i>Drosophila</i> followed by integrative data analysis of microbiome and transcriptome. We also verified our findings by transplanting <i>Drosophila</i> with fecal samples from clinical PD patients. Our results demonstrated that PD-associated gut microbiota can induce differentially expressed genes enriched in diverse metabolic pathways. This study can help better understand the link between gut microbiota and PD pathogenesis through gut-brain axis.
