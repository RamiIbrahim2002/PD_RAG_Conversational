Abstract:
In this paper, we develop a new cortex-pallidum model to study the origin mechanism of Parkinson's oscillations in the cortex. In contrast to many previous models, the globus pallidus internal (GPi) and externa (GPe) both exert direct inhibitory feedback to the cortex. Using Hopf bifurcation analysis, two new critical conditions for oscillations, which can include the self-feedback projection of GPe, are obtained. In this paper, we find that the average discharge rate (ADR) is an important marker of oscillations, which can divide Hopf bifurcations into two types that can uniformly be used to explain the oscillation mechanism. Interestingly, the ADR of the cortex first increases and then decreases with increasing coupling weights that are projected to the GPe. Regarding the Hopf bifurcation critical conditions, the quantitative relationship between the inhibitory projection and excitatory projection to the GPe is monotonically increasing; in contrast, the relationship between different coupling weights in the cortex is monotonically decreasing. In general, the oscillation amplitude is the lowest near the bifurcation points and reaches the maximum value with the evolution of oscillations. The GPe is an effective target for deep brain stimulation to alleviate oscillations in the cortex.
