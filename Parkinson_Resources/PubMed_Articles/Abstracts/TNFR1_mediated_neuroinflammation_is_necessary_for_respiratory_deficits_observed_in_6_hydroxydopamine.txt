Abstract:
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by classic motor symptoms related to movement, but PD patients can experience symptoms associated with impaired autonomic function, such as respiratory disturbances. Functional respiratory deficits are known to be associated with brainstem neurodegeneration in the mice model of PD induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Understanding the causes of neuronal death is essential for identifying specific targets to prevent degeneration. Many mechanisms can explain why neurons die in PD, and neuroinflammation is one of them. To test the influence of inflammation, mediated by microglia and astrocytes cells, in the respiratory disturbances associated with brainstem neurons death, we submitted wild-type (WT) and TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) knockout male mice to the 6-OHDA model of PD. Also, male C57BL/6 animals were induced using the same PD model and treated with minocycline (45 mg/kg), a tetracycline antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties. We show that degeneration of brainstem areas such as the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) and the pre-Botzinger Complex (preBotC) were prevented in both protocols. Notably, respiratory disturbances were no longer observed in the animals where inflammation was suppressed. Thus, the data demonstrate that inflammation is responsible for the breathing impairment in the 6-OHDA-induced PD mouse model.
