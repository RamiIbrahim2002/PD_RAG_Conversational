PMID: 37854895

Abstract:
National as well as international Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment guidelines are available to guide clinicians. Previous research has shown that nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are pronounced in late-stage PD and has suggested that current treatment is insufficient and could be improved.
