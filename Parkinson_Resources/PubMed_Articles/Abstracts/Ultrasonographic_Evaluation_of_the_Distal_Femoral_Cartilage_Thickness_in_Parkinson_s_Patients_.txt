Title: Ultrasonographic Evaluation of the Distal Femoral Cartilage Thickness in Parkinson's Patients.
PMID: 37654218

Abstract:
Both Parkinson's disease (PD) and osteoarthritis (OA) are characterized by chronic inflammation and tissue degeneration. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between PD and distal femoral cartilage thickness (DFCT). Our study is the first in the literature to measure DFCT in PD.
