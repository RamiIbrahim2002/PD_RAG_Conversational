Title: Transforming Drug Development for Neurological Disorders: Proceedings from a Multidisease Area Workshop.
PMID: 37823970

Abstract:
Neurological disorders represent some of the most challenging therapeutic areas for successful drug approvals. The escalating global burden of death and disability for such diseases represents a significant worldwide public health challenge, and the rate of failure of new therapies for chronic progressive disorders of the nervous system is higher relative to other non-neurological conditions. However, progress is emerging rapidly in advancing the drug development landscape in both rare and common neurodegenerative diseases. In October 2022, the Critical Path Institute (C-Path) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) organized a Neuroscience Annual Workshop convening representatives from the drug development industry, academia, the patient community, government agencies, and regulatory agencies regarding the future development of tools and therapies for neurological disorders. This workshop focused on five chronic progressive diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and inherited ataxias. This special conference report reviews the key points discussed during the three-day dynamic workshop, including shared learnings, and recommendations that promise to catalyze future advancement of novel therapies and drug development tools.
