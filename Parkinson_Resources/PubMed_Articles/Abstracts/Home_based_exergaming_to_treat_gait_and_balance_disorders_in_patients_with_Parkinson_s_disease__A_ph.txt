PMID: 37691341

Exergaming has been proposed to improve gait and balance disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. We aimed to assess the efficacy of a home-based, tailored, exergaming training system designed for PD patients with dopa-resistant gait and/or balance disorders in a controlled randomized trial.
