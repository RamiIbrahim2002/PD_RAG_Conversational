Title: Fluctuations in Upper and Lower Body Movement during Walking in Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus and Parkinson's Disease Assessed by Motion Capture with a Smartphone Application, TDPT-GT.
PMID: 38005649

Abstract:
We aimed to capture the fluctuations in the dynamics of body positions and find the characteristics of them in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and Parkinson's disease (PD). With the motion-capture application (TDPT-GT) generating 30 Hz coordinates at 27 points on the body, walking in a circle 1 m in diameter was recorded for 23 of iNPH, 23 of PD, and 92 controls. For 128 frames of calculated distances from the navel to the other points, after the Fourier transforms, the slopes (the representatives of fractality) were obtained from the graph plotting the power spectral density against the frequency in log-log coordinates. Differences in the average slopes were tested by one-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons between every two groups. A decrease in the absolute slope value indicates a departure from the 1/f noise characteristic observed in healthy variations. Significant differences in the patient groups and controls were found in all body positions, where patients always showed smaller absolute values. Our system could measure the whole body's movement and temporal variations during walking. The impaired fluctuations of body movement in the upper and lower body may contribute to gait and balance disorders in patients.
