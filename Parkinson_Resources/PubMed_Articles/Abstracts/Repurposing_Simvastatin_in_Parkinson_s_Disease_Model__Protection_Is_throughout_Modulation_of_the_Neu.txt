Title: Repurposing Simvastatin in Parkinson's Disease Model: Protection Is throughout Modulation of the Neuro-Inflammatory Response in the <i>Substantia nigra</i>.
PMID: 37445592

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by oxidative stress and immune activation in the nigro-striatal pathway. Simvastatin regulates cholesterol metabolism and protects from atherosclerosis disease. Simvastatin-tween 80 was administered 7 days before sterotaxic intrastriatal administration of MPP<sup>+</sup> (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine) in rats. Fluorescent lipidic product formation, dopamine levels, and circling behavior were considered damage markers. Twenty-four hours and six days after, the animal group lesioned with MPP<sup>+</sup> showed significant damage in relation to the control group. Animals pretreated with simvastatin significantly reduced the MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced damage compared to the MPP<sup>+</sup> treated group. As apoptosis promotes neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease, and since there is not currently a proteomic map of the nigro-striatum of rats and assuming a high homology among the identified proteins in other rat tissues, we based the search for rat protein homologs related to the establishment of inflammation response. We demonstrate that most proteins related to inflammation decreased in the simvastatin-treated rats. Furthermore, differential expression of antioxidant enzymes in striated tissue of rat brains was found in response to simvastatin. These results suggest that simvastatin could prevent striatal MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced damage and, for the first time, suggest that the molecular mechanisms involved in this have a protective effect.
