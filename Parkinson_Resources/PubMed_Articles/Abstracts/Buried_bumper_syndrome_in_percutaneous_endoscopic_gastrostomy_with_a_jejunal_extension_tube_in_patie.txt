PMID: 38072871

Abstract:
Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) treatment is an effective Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment that requires percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with a jejunal extension tube (PEG-J). Buried bumper syndrome (BBS) is an uncommon but significant complication of PEG-J for LCIG. Case presentation A 71-year-old man had been undergoing LCIG therapy for PD since a PEG-J was implemented at our department two years previously. He presented with appetite loss. Computed tomography showed that the gastrostomy bumper was buried in the gastric wall. The patient was surgically treated with the simultaneous removal and replacement of PEG-J. Postoperative gastrocutaneous fistula occurred, which was conservatively treated.
