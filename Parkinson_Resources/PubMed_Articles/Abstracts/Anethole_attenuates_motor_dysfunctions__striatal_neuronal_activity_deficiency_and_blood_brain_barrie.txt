PMID: 37972114

Abstract:
Anethole is the main compound of the essential oil of anise and several other plants, which has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. Oxidative stress is considered as an important factor in the pathogenesis of PD. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of anethole against rotenone-induced PD.
