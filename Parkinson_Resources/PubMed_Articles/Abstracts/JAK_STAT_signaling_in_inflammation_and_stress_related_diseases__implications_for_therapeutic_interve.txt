Title: JAK-STAT signaling in inflammation and stress-related diseases: implications for therapeutic interventions.
PMID: 37938494

Abstract:
The Janus kinase-signal transducer and transcription activator pathway (JAK-STAT) serves as a cornerstone in cellular signaling, regulating physiological and pathological processes such as inflammation and stress. Dysregulation in this pathway can lead to severe immunodeficiencies and malignancies, and its role extends to neurotransduction and pro-inflammatory signaling mechanisms. Although JAK inhibitors (Jakinibs) have successfully treated immunological and inflammatory disorders, their application has generally been limited to diseases with similar pathogenic features. Despite the modest expression of JAK-STAT in the CNS, it is crucial for functions in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, making it relevant in conditions like Parkinson's disease and other neuroinflammatory disorders. Furthermore, the influence of the pathway on serotonin receptors and phospholipase C has implications for stress and mood disorders. This review expands the understanding of JAK-STAT, moving beyond traditional immunological contexts to explore its role in stress-related disorders and CNS function. Recent findings, such as the effectiveness of Jakinibs in chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, expand their therapeutic applicability. Advances in isoform-specific inhibitors, including filgotinib and upadacitinib, promise greater specificity with fewer off-target effects. Combination therapies, involving Jakinibs and monoclonal antibodies, aiming to enhance therapeutic specificity and efficacy also give great hope. Overall, this review bridges the gap between basic science and clinical application, elucidating the complex influence of the JAK-STAT pathway on human health and guiding future interventions.
