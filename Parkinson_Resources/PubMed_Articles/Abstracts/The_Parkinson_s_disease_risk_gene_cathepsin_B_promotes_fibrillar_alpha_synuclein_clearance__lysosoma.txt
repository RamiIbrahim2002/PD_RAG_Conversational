Abstract:
Variants in the <i>CTSB</i> gene encoding the lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin B (catB) are associated with increased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, neither the specific <i>CTSB</i> variants driving these associations nor the functional pathways that link catB to PD pathogenesis have been characterized. CatB activity contributes to lysosomal protein degradation and regulates signaling processes involved in autophagy and lysosome biogenesis. Previous <i>in vitro</i> studies have found that catB can cleave monomeric and fibrillar alpha-synuclein, a key protein involved in the pathogenesis of PD that accumulates in the brains of PD patients. However, truncated synuclein isoforms generated by catB cleavage have an increased propensity to aggregate. Thus, catB activity could potentially contribute to lysosomal degradation and clearance of pathogenic alpha synuclein from the cell, but also has the potential of enhancing synuclein pathology by generating aggregation-prone truncations. Therefore, the mechanisms linking catB to PD pathophysiology remain to be clarified. Here, we conducted genetic analyses of the association between common and rare <i>CTSB</i> variants and risk of PD. We then used genetic and pharmacological approaches to manipulate catB expression and function in cell lines and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons and assessed lysosomal activity and the handling of aggregated synuclein fibrils. We find that catB inhibition impairs autophagy, reduces glucocerebrosidase (encoded by <i>GBA1</i>) activity, and leads to an accumulation of lysosomal content. In cell lines, reduction of <i>CTSB</i> gene expression impairs the degradation of pre-formed alpha-synuclein fibrils, whereas <i>CTSB</i> gene activation enhances fibril clearance. In midbrain organoids and dopaminergic neurons treated with alpha-synuclein fibrils, catB inhibition potentiates the formation of inclusions which stain positively for phosphorylated alpha-synuclein. These results indicate that the reduction of catB function negatively impacts lysosomal pathways associated with PD pathogenesis, while conversely catB activation could promote the clearance of pathogenic alpha-synuclein.
