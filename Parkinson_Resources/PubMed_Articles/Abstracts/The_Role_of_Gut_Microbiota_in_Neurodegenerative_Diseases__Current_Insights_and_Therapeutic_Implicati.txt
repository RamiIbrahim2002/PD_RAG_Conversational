Title: The Role of Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Current Insights and Therapeutic Implications.
PMID: 38022117

Abstract:
Small microscopic entities known as microbes, having a population of hundreds of billions or perhaps even in trillions, reside in our gastrointestinal tract. A healthy immune system, digestion, and creation of vitamins and enzymes are all thanks to these microbes. However, new research has shown a hitherto unrecognized connection between the microbiota of the intestines and the genesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurons in the CNS gradually deteriorate in neurodegenerative illnesses like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease (PD). This deterioration impairs cognitive and physical function. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), PD, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are just a few examples of neurodegenerative illnesses that pose a serious threat to world health and have few effective treatments. Recent research suggests that the gut microbiota, a diverse microbial population found in the gastrointestinal system, may substantially impact the cause and development of various diseases. The discovery of altered gut microbiota composition in people with these illnesses is one of the most critical lines of evidence connecting gut microbiota dysbiosis to neurodegenerative diseases. AD patients have a distinct characteristic of having a particular microbiota profile. In addition, an excess population of a specific microbe data profile is seen as compared to a healthy individual. Similar changes in the gut microbiota composition have been noted in people with multiple sclerosis and PD. The latest study indicates the potential that dysbiosis, a condition characterized by alteration in the intestinal microbiota's makeup and functioning, may have an effect on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD and multiple sclerosis. In order to emphasize any potential underlying mechanisms and examine potential treatment repercussions, the review article's goal is to summarize current knowledge about the connection between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative disorders. The review article aims to summarize current knowledge about the connection between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting potential underlying mechanisms and examining potential treatment repercussions.
