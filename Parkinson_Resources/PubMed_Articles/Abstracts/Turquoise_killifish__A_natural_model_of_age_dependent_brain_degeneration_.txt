Title: Turquoise killifish: A natural model of age-dependent brain degeneration.
PMID: 37482345

Abstract:
Turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) are naturally short-lived vertebrates that display a wide range of spontaneous age-related changes, including onset of cancer, reduced mobility, and cognitive decline. Here, we focus on describing the phenotypic spectrum of the aging killifish brain. As turquoise killifish age, their dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons undergo a significant decline in number. Furthermore, brain aging in turquoise killifish is associated with several glial-specific changes, such as an increase in the astrocyte-covered surface area and an increase in the numbers of microglial cells, i.e. the brain-specific macrophage population. Killifish brains undergo age-dependent reduced proteasome activity and increased protein aggregation, including the aggregation of the Parkinson's disease marker Î±-synuclein. Parallel to brain degeneration, turquoise killifish develop spontaneous age-related gut dysbiosis, which has been proposed to affect human neurodegenerative disease. Finally, aged turquoise killifish display declined learning capacity. We argue that, taken together, the molecular, cellular and functional changes that spontaneously take place during aging in killifish brains are consistent with a robust degenerative process that shares remarkable similarities with human neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, we propose that turquoise killifish represent a powerful model of spontaneous brain degeneration which can be effectively used to explore the causal mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.
