Title: Immediate Effects of High-Cadence Cycling on Core Outcomes in Individuals With Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37573028

Abstract:
Despite a strong body of evidence supporting benefits of exercise to reduce severity of motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) over time, research on the immediate impact of exercise as an adjunctive therapy for nonpharmacologic management of motor symptoms and mobility performance in people with PD is limited. The purpose of this study was to examine immediate effects of a single bout of high-cadence cycling on motor symptoms of PD and performance-based outcomes. Twenty individuals with idiopathic PD participated in a pretest/posttest study investigating immediate impacts of a single high-cadence cycling session on performance-based outcomes across multiple domains of motor function, mobility, and balance. Outcomes were analyzed based on time since last dose of levodopa/carbidopa medication. Immediate improvements were observed in motor symptoms of PD with significant improvements in performance across multiple balance systems, dynamic gait, and upper-extremity coordination following a cycling intervention.
