Title: Microglia-dependent neuroprotective effects of 4-octyl itaconate against rotenone-and MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37730914

Abstract:
Chronic neuroinflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Itaconate, an endogenous metabolite derived from the tricarboxylic acid cycle via immune-responsive gene 1 activity, may mediate anti-inflammatory responses by activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant pathway. This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of 4-octyl itaconate (OI), a cell-permeable derivative of itaconate, in cellular models of PD. OI not only suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory cascades of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and cytokines release in mouse BV2 microglial cells but also activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway and its downstream targets in these cells. Conditioned medium derived from OI-treated BV2 cells protected against rotenone- and MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced neurotoxicity in Neuro 2A cells. Overall, our findings support the anti-inflammatory neuroprotective potential of OI in PD.
