PMID: 37782207

Abstract:
Opicapone (OPC) is a third-generation peripheral catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor (COMT-i) approved as add-on therapy to levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (DDCI) combinations in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations. While the OPC effectiveness on motor symptoms is well known, there is still uncertainty about the timing of introduction, the management of levodopa dose, and the efficacy on non-motor symptoms (NMS).
