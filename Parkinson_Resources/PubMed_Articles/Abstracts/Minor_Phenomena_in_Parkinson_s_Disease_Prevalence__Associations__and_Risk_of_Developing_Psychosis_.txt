Title: Minor Phenomena in Parkinson's Disease-Prevalence, Associations, and Risk of Developing Psychosis.
PMID: 37542397

Abstract:
Minor phenomena, including passage phenomena, feeling of presence, and illusions, are common and may represent a prodromal form of psychosis in Parkinson's disease (PD). We examined the prevalence and clinical correlates of minor phenomena, and their potential role as a risk factor for PD psychosis.
