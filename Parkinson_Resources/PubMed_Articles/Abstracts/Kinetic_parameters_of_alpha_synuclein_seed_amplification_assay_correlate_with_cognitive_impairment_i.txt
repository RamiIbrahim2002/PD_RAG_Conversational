Abstract:
The alpha-synuclein (aSyn) seed amplification assay (SAA) can identify aSyn aggregates as indicator for Lewy body pathology in biomaterials of living patients and help in diagnosing ParkinsonÂ´s disease and dementia syndromes. Our objective was to confirm that qualitative results of aSyn SAA are reproducible across laboratories and to determine whether quantitative findings correlate with patient clinical characteristics. Therefore cerebrospinal fluid samples were re-analysed by aSyn SAA in a second laboratory with four technical replicates for each sample. Kinetic parameters derived from each aggregation curve were summarized and correlated with patient characteristics. We found that qualitative findings were identical between the two laboratories for 54 of 55 patient samples. The number of positive replicates for each sample also showed good agreement between laboratories. Moreover, specific kinetic parameters of the SAA showed a strong correlation with clinical parameters, notably with cognitive performance evaluated by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. We concluded that SAA findings are highly reproducible across laboratories following the same protocol. SAA reports not only the presence of Lewy pathology but is also associated with clinical characteristics. Thus, aSyn SAA can potentially be used for patient stratification and determining the target engagement of aSyn targeting treatments.
