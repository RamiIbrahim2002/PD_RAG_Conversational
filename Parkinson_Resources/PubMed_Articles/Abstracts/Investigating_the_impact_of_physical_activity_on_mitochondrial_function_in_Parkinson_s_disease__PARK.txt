Title: Investigating the impact of physical activity on mitochondrial function in Parkinson's disease (PARKEX): Study protocol for A randomized controlled clinical trial.
PMID: 37992028

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive dopaminergic neuron degeneration, resulting in striatal dopamine deficiency. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with PD pathogenesis. Physical activity (PA) has been shown to ameliorate neurological impairments and to impede age-related neuronal loss. In addition, skin fibroblasts have been identified as surrogate indicators of pathogenic processes correlating with clinical measures. The PARKEX study aims to compare the effects of two different PA programs, analyzing the impact on mitochondrial function in patients' skin fibroblasts as biomarkers for disease status and metabolic improvement. Early-stage PD patients (n = 24, H&Y stage I to III) will be randomized into three age- and sex-matched groups. Group 1 (n = 8) will undergo basic physical training (BPT) emphasizing strength and resistance. Group 2 (n = 8) will undergo BPT combined with functional exercises (BPTFE), targeting the sensorimotor pathways that are most affected in PD (proprioception-balance-coordination) together with cognitive and motor training (Dual task training). Group 3 (n = 8) will serve as control (sedentary group; Sed). Participants will perform three sessions per week for 12 weeks. Assessment of motor function, quality of life, sleep quality, cognitive aspects and humor will be conducted pre- and post-intervention. Patient skin fibroblasts will be collected before and after the intervention and characterized in terms of metabolic remodeling and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Ethical approval has been given to commence this study. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05963425). Trial registration. https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/history/NCT05963425.
