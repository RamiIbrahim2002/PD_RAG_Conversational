Title: Modeling familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease in small fishes.
PMID: 37991125

Abstract:
The establishment of animal models for Parkinson's disease (PD) has been challenging. Nevertheless, once established, they will serve as valuable tools for elucidating the causes and pathogenesis of PD, as well as for developing new strategies for its treatment. Following the recent discovery of a series of PD causative genes in familial cases, teleost fishes, including zebrafish and medaka, have often been used to establish genetic PD models because of their ease of breeding and gene manipulation, as well as the high conservation of gene orthologs. Some of the fish lines can recapitulate PD phenotypes, which are often more pronounced than those in rodent genetic models. In addition, a new experimental teleost fish, turquoise killifish, can be used as a sporadic PD model, because it spontaneously manifests age-dependent PD phenotypes. Several PD fish models have already made significant contributions to the discovery of novel PD pathological features, such as cytosolic leakage of mitochondrial DNA and pathogenic phosphorylation in Î±-synuclein. Therefore, utilizing various PD fish models with distinct degenerative phenotypes will be an effective strategy for identifying emerging facets of PD pathogenesis and therapeutic modalities.
