Title: Relationship between Parkinson's disease and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases: a Mendelian randomized study.
PMID: 37993489

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) and cardio-cerebrovascular diseases are related, according to earlier studies, but these studies have some controversy. Our aim was to assess the impact of PD on cardiocerebrovascular diseases using a Mendelian randomization (MR) method. The data for PD were single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset containing data on 482,730 individuals. And the outcome SNPs data is were derived from five different GWAS datasets. The basic method for MR analysis was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) approach. We use the weighted median method and the MR-Egger method to supplement the MR analysis conclusion. Finally, We used Cochran's Q test to test heterogeneity, MR-PRESSO method and leave-one-out analysis method to perform sensitivity analysis. We used ratio ratios (OR) to assess the strength of the association between exposure and outcome, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to show the reliability of the results. Our findings imply that PD is linked to a higher occurrence of coronary artery disease (CAD) (OR = 1.055, 95% CI 1.020-1.091, P = 0.001), stroke (OR = 1.039, 95% CI 1.007-1.072, P = 0.014). IVW analyses for stroke's subgroups of ischemic stroke (IS) and 95% CI 1.007-1.072, P = 0.014). IVW analyses for stroke's subgroups of ischemic stroke (IS) and cardioembolic stroke (CES) also yielded positive results, respectively (OR = 1.043, 95% CI 1.008-1.079, P = 0.013), (OR = 1.076, 95% CI 1.008-1.149, P = 0.026). There is no evidence of a relationship between PD and other cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Additionally, sensitivity analysis revealed reliable outcomes. Our MR study analysis that PD is related with an elevated risk of CAD, stroke, IS, and CES.
