PMID: 37831394

Abstract:
Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia that occurs during REM sleep, characterized by REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) and dream enactment behavior (DEB). RBD is associated with several diseases and medications but most notably is a prodromal feature of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD). This article reviews RBD, its treatments, and implications for PD therapeutics.
