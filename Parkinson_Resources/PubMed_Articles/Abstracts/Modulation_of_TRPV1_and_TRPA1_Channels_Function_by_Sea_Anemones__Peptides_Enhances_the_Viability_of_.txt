Abstract:
Cellular dysfunction during Parkinson's disease leads to neuroinflammation in various brain regions, inducing neuronal death and contributing to the progression of the disease. Different ion channels may influence the process of neurodegeneration. The peptides Ms 9a-1 and APHC3 can modulate the function of TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels, and we evaluated their cytoprotective effects in differentiated to dopaminergic neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells. We used the stable neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y, producing wild-type alpha-synuclein and its mutant A53T, which are prone to accumulation of thioflavin-S-positive aggregates. We analyzed the viability of cells, as well as the mRNA expression levels of TRPA1, TRPV1, ASIC1a channels, alpha-synuclein, and tyrosine hydroxylase after differentiation of these cell lines using RT-PCR. Overexpression of alpha-synuclein showed a neuroprotective effect and was accompanied by a reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase expression. A mutant alpha-synuclein A53T significantly increased the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX and made cells more susceptible to apoptosis. Generally, overexpression of alpha-synuclein could be a model for the early stages of PD, while expression of mutant alpha-synuclein A53T mimics a genetic variant of PD. The peptides Ms 9a-1 and APHC3 significantly reduced the susceptibility to apoptosis of all cell lines but differentially influenced the expression of the genes of interest. Therefore, these modulators of TRPA1 and TRPV1 have the potential for the development of new therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disease treatment.
