Title: Cerebrospinal fluid and blood serum biomarkers in neurodegenerative proteinopathies: A prospective, open, cross-correlation study.
PMID: 37680022

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases are a broad heterogeneous group affecting the nervous system. They are characterized, from a pathophysiological perspective, by the selective involvement of a subpopulation of nerve cells with a consequent clinical picture of a disease. Clinical diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases are quite challenging and often not completely accurate because of their marked heterogeneity and frequently overlapping clinical pictures. Efforts are being made to define sufficiently specific and sensitive markers for individual neurodegenerative diseases or groups of diseases in order to increase the accuracy and speed of clinical diagnosis. Thus said, this present research aimed to identify biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum (α-synuclein [α-syn], tau protein [t-tau], phosphorylated tau protein [p-tau], β-amyloid [Aβ], clusterin, chromogranin A [chromogrA], cystatin C [cyst C], neurofilament heavy chains [NFH], phosphorylated form of neurofilament heavy chains [pNF-H], and ratio of tau protein/amyloid beta [Ind tau/Aβ]) that could help in the differential diagnosis and differentiation of the defined groups of α-synucleinopathies and four-repeat (4R-) tauopathies characterized by tau protein isoforms with four microtubule-binding domains. In this study, we analyzed a cohort of 229 patients divided into four groups: (1) Parkinson's disease (PD) + dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n = 82), (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA) (n = 25), (3) progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) + corticobasal syndrome (CBS) (n = 30), and (4) healthy controls (HC) (n = 92). We also focused on analyzing the biomarkers in relation to each other with the intention of determining whether they are useful in distinguishing among individual proteinopathies. Our results indicate that the proposed set of biomarkers, when evaluated in CSF, is likely to be useful for the differential diagnosis of MSA versus 4RT. However, these biomarkers do not seem to provide any useful diagnostic information when assessed in blood serum.
