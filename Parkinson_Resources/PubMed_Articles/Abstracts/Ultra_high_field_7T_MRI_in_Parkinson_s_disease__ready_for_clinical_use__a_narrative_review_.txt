Title: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI in Parkinson's disease: ready for clinical use?-a narrative review.
PMID: 37969629

Abstract:
The maturation of ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [â‰¥7 Tesla (7T)] has improved our capability to depict and characterise brain structures efficiently, with better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution. We evaluated whether these improvements benefit the clinical detection and management of Parkinson's disease (PD).
