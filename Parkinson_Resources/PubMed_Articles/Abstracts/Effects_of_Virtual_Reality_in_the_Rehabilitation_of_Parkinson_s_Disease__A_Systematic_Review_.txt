PMID: 37568298

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease is characterised by the loss of balance and the presence of walking difficulties. The inclusion of rehabilitation therapies to complement pharmacological therapy allows for comprehensive management of the disease. In recent years, virtual reality has been gaining importance in the treatment of neurological diseases and their associated symptoms. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review was to analyse the effectiveness of virtual reality on balance and gait in patients with Parkinson's disease.
