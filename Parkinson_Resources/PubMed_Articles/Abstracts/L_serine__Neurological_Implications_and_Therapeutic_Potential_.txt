Title: L-serine: Neurological Implications and Therapeutic Potential.
PMID: 37626614

Abstract:
L-serine is a non-essential amino acid that plays a vital role in protein synthesis, cell proliferation, development, and sphingolipid formation in the central nervous system. It exerts its effects through the activation of glycine receptors and upregulation of PPAR-Î³, resulting in neurotransmitter synthesis, neuroprotection, and anti-inflammatory effects. L-serine shows potential as a protective agent in various neurological diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Deficiency of L-serine and its downstream products has been linked to severe neurological deficits. Despite its crucial role, there is limited understanding of its mechanistic production and impact on glial and neuronal cells. Most of the focus has been on D-serine, the downstream product of L-serine, which has been implicated in a wide range of neurological diseases. However, L-serine is approved by FDA for supplemental use, while D-serine is not. Hence, it is imperative that we investigate the wider effects of L-serine, particularly in relation to the pathogenesis of several neurological deficits that, in turn, lead to diseases. This review aims to explore current knowledge surrounding L-serine and its potential as a treatment for various neurological diseases and neurodegenerative disorders.
