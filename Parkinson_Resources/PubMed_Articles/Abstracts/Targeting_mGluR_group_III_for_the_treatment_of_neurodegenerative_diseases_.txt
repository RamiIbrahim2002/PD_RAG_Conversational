Title: Targeting mGluR group III for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
PMID: 37862967

Abstract:
Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, is essential for neuronal function, and it acts on ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). A disturbance in glutamatergic signaling is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Developing disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative diseases targeting glutamate receptors is a promising avenue. The understudied group III mGluR 4, 6-8 are commonly found in the presynaptic membrane, and their activation inhibits glutamate release. Thus, targeted mGluRs therapies could aid in treating neurodegenerative diseases. This review describes group III mGluRs and their pharmacological ligands in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases. Attempts to evaluate the efficacy of these drugs in clinical trials are also discussed. Despite a growing list of group III mGluR-specific pharmacological ligands, research on the use of these drugs in neurodegenerative diseases is limited, except for Parkinson's disease. Future efforts should focus on delineating the contribution of group III mGluR to neurodegeneration and developing novel ligands with superior efficacy and a favorable side effect profile for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
