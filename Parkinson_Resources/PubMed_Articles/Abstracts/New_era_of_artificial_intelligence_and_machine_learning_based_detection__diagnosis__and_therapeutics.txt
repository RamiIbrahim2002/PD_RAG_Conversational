Title: New era of artificial intelligence and machine learning-based detection, diagnosis, and therapeutics in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37429545

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of neuronal cells, which leads to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive defects. Despite the advancements in treatment strategies, the management of PD is still a challenging event. Early prediction and diagnosis of PD are of utmost importance for effective management of PD. In addition, the classification of patients with PD as compared to normal healthy individuals also imposes drawbacks in the early diagnosis of PD. To address these challenges, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models have been implicated in the diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of PD. Recent times have also demonstrated the implication of AI and ML models in the classification of PD based on neuroimaging methods, speech recording, gait abnormalities, and others. Herein, we have briefly discussed the role of AI and ML in the diagnosis, treatment, and identification of novel biomarkers in the progression of PD. We have also highlighted the role of AI and ML in PD management through altered lipidomics and gut-brain axis. We briefly explain the role of early PD detection through AI and ML algorithms based on speech recordings, handwriting patterns, gait abnormalities, and neuroimaging techniques. Further, the review discuss the potential role of the metaverse, the Internet of Things, and electronic health records in the effective management of PD to improve the quality of life. Lastly, we also focused on the implementation of AI and ML-algorithms in neurosurgical process and drug discovery.
