Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is often accompanied by depression, which may appear before motor signs. Oleanolic acid (OA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid substance, have many pharmacological properties. However, its efficacy in treating PD-related chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) is unknown. Our study used behavioral, biochemical, and immunohistochemical techniques to assess how OA affected PDrelated CUS. Rotenone (1 mg/kg i.p. for first 21 days) was used to induce Parkinsonism, and modest psychological & environmental stresses generated CUS (from day 22 to day 43) in animals. The study included daily <i>i.p.</i>administration of OA (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) from day 1 to day 57 in male swiss albino mice. Animals were evaluated for behavioral, biochemical parameters, neurotransmitters, and immunohistochemical expression following the treatment. Results of the study revealed that treatment with OA at all doses alleviated the core symptoms of CUS linked to PD and improved motor and non-motor function. OA therapy significantly lowered IL-1β, TNF-α (<i>p</i> < 0.01, < 0.01, < 0.001), IL-6 (<i>p</i> < 0.05, < 0.01, < 0.001), oxidative stress (<i>p</i> < 0.05, < 0.01, < 0.01), and elevated norepinephrine (<i>p</i> < 0.05, < 0.01, < 0.01), dopamine, and serotonin (<i>p</i> < 0.05, < 0.01, < 0.001) levels. Moreover, OA therapy substantially reduced α-synuclein (<i>p</i> < 0.05, < 0.01, < 0.01) aggregation and increased BDNF (<i>p</i> < 0.05, < 0.01, < 0.001) & Nrf-2 (<i>p</i> < 0.05, < 0.01, < 0.01) levels, which boosts neuronal dopamine survival. The study's findings indicated that OA ameliorates depressive-like behavior persuaded by CUS in PD, decreases neuroinflammation, and improves neurotransmitter concentration <i>via</i> activating Nrf2-BDNF-dopaminergic pathway.
