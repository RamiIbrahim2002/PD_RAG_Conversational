Title: Membrane phospholipid peroxidation promotes loss of dopaminergic neurons in psychological stress-induced Parkinson's disease susceptibility.
PMID: 37622525

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with α-synuclein aggregation and dopaminergic neuron loss in the midbrain. There is evidence that psychological stress promotes PD progression by enhancing glucocorticoids-related oxidative damage, however, the mechanisms involved are unknown. The present study demonstrated that plasma membrane phospholipid peroxides, as determined by phospholipidomics, triggered ferroptosis in dopaminergic neurons, which in turn contributed to stress exacerbated PD-like motor disorder in mice overexpressing mutant human α-synuclein. Using hormonomics, we identified that stress stimulated corticosteroid release and promoted 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15)-mediated phospholipid peroxidation. ALOX15 was upregulated by α-synuclein overexpression and acted as a fundamental risk factor in the development of chronic stress-induced parkinsonism and neurodegeneration. Further, we demonstrated the mechanism by which corticosteroids activated the PKC pathway and induced phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein-1 (PEBP1) to form a complex with ALOX15, thereby facilitating ALOX15 to locate on the plasma membrane phospholipids. A natural product isolated from herbs, leonurine, was screened with activities of inhibiting the ALOX15/PEBP1 interaction and thereby attenuating membrane phospholipid peroxidation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that stress increases the susceptibility of PD by driving membrane lipid peroxidation of dopaminergic neurons and suggest the ALOX15/PEBP1 complex as a potential intervention target.
