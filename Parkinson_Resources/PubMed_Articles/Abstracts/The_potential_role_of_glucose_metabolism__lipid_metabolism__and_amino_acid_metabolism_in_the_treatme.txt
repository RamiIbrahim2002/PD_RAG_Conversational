PMID: 37577934

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, which can cause progressive deterioration of motor function causing muscle stiffness, tremor, and bradykinesia. In this review, we hope to describe approaches that can improve the life of PD patients through modifications of energy metabolism.
