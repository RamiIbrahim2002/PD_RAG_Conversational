PMID: 37532554

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms and neuropathological features, such as loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-Syn). Progranulin (PGRN) is a secreted growth factor that exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and regulates lysosomal function. Although autophagy-lysosome pathway is the main degradative pathway for α-Syn, the molecular mechanistic relationship between PD and PGRN remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of PGRN in PD pathology. PGRN protein expression in striatum was increased in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model mice. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of PGRN ameliorated the decrease in expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, a dopaminergic neuron marker, in MPTP-treated mice. Furthermore, i.c.v. administration of PGRN ameliorated 6-hydroxydopamine-induced motor deficits. In SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP<sup>+</sup>), an active metabolite of MPTP, increased α-Syn expression. In contrast, PGRN ameliorated MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced increase in α-Syn expression. Although PGRN decreased the levels of autophagy-related proteins Sequestosome-1 (p62) and MAP1LC3 (LC3)-II, PGRN did not influence the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase and mechanistic target of rapamycin, which are also proteins that regulate autophagy. Immunostaining analysis showed that PGRN ameliorated MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced increase of LC3 puncta, indicator of autophagosome, and co-localization of LC3 and α-Syn. The DALGreen assay showed that PGRN ameliorated MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced decreasing trend of autolysosomes. These results suggest that PGRN participates in α-Syn degradation via acceleration of the autophagy-lysosome pathway and is a potential therapeutic target for PD.
