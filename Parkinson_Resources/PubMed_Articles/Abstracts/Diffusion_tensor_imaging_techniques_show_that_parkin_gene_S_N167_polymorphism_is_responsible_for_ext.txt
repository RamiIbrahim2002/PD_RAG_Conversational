Abstract:
To explore the influence of disease and genetic factors on the white matter microstructure in patients with PD. The white matter microstructural changes in the substantia nigra-striatum system were detected by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using the region of interest (ROI) and diffusion tensor tracer (DTT) methods.
