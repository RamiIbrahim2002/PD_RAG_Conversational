Title: The Effect of Skeletal Muscle-Pump on Blood Pressure and Postural Control in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37749359

Abstract:
Activation of the calf (gastrocnemius and soleus) and tibialis anterior muscles play an important role in blood pressure regulation (via muscle-pump mechanism) and postural control. Parkinson's disease is associated with calf (and tibialis anterior muscles weakness and stiffness, which contribute to postural instability and associated falls. In this work, we studied the role of the medial and lateral gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, and soleus muscle contractions in maintaining blood pressure and postural stability in Parkinson's patients and healthy controls during standing. In addition, we investigated whether the activation of the calf and tibialis anterior muscles is baroreflex dependent or postural-mediated.
