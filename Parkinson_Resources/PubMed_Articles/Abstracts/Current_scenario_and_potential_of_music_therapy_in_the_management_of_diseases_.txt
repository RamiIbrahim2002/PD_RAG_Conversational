PMID: 37944563

Abstract:
Over the preceding years, music therapy has gained tremendous attention due to new findings of music in management of various conditions like Alzheimer's, depression, anxiety, insomnia, etc. Music is a non-invasive, patient-friendly and pleasant form of therapy with minimal or no side effects. It activates the reward pathway of brain by influencing several processes such as dopamine release, reduction in cortisol levels, increase in estrogen and testosterone levels. This review article focuses on advantages and disadvantages of music therapy, mechanism of action of music in brain and its effective applications in the management of different diseases. The article covers history of music therapy in America, Egypt, and India with practice of music therapy. The advanced effects of music therapy in autism, cancer, post-operative pain, Parkinson's disease, selective mutism, stroke, heart problems, pregnancy, eating disorders, bone fractures and obsessive compulsive disorders are discussed. Also the effect of music therapy on the quality of sleep and brain waves has been discussed. This is an established profession in western countries like America, UK, Australia, and Canada, but not in low-income countries like India where it needs to be standardized.
