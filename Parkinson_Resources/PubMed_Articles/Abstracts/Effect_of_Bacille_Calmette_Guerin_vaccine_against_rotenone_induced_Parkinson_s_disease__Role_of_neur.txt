Title: Effect of Bacille-Calmette-Guerin vaccine against rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease: Role of neuroinflammation and neurotransmitters.
PMID: 38041521

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is an extrapyramidal movement disorder associated with a hypokinetic condition generated by impairment in dopaminergic neuronal viability in the nigrostriatal region of the brain. Current medications can only provide symptomatic management; to date, no permanent cure is available. To compensate for this lacuna, researchers are gaining interest in antigen-based therapy, and Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is one of the vaccines with a high safety margin that acts by stimulating immunoreactive T-cells in the CNS and reducing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrotic factor (TNF-α) to produce neuroprotection. A previous study reported that BCG exerts a neuroprotective effect against several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.
