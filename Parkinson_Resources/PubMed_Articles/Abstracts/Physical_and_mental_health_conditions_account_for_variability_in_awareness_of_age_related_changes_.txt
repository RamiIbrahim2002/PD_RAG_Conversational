PMID: 37539325

Abstract:
The concept of Awareness of Age-Related Changes captures people's perceptions of the positive (AARC-gains) and negative (AARC-losses) age-related changes they experience in several life domains, including their health. We investigated the cross-sectional associations of number and type of physical and mental health conditions with AARC-gains and AARC-losses.
