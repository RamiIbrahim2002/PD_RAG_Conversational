Title: Dataset for diseases associated with exposure to broflanilide, a novel pesticide, in larval zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>).
PMID: 37727589

Abstract:
Broflanilide is a novel pesticide that can antagonize ion channels and disrupt neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Zebrafish larvae were exposed to either 0, 1 or 10- µg/L broflanilide in the water for a period of 7 days during early development. RNA extraction was conducted on larval zebrafish for RNA-seq analysis using the Illumina NovoSeq 6000. Raw sequence data were processed through fastp and clean reads obtained by removing adapter and poly-N sequences. Alignment and differential gene expression analysis was conducted using HISAT2, StringTie assembler, and FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Millions base pairs sequenced). Subnetwork enrichment analysis (SNEA) revealed that exposure to 1 µg/L broflanilide altered gene networks associated with axonal injury, depression, neuroinflammation, and traumatic brain injury while exposure to 10- µg/L broflanilide resulted in changes in gene networks associated with brain infarction and ischemia, excitotoxicity, and neurogenic inflammation. In addition, genes related to MPTP-induced neurotoxicity were altered by broflanilide which has relevance for Parkinson's disease. Several transcripts were identified as being associated with a disease network link to neurodegeneration and included phospholipase A2 activating protein, calpain 1, ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 2, glia maturation factor beta, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1, leucine rich repeat kinase 2, glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2C, lysosomal associated membrane protein, and calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II alpha among others. Data presented here include disease biomarkers for a novel pesticide and can be reused to refine models that describe adverse outcome pathways for neurotoxicity.
