Title: Engrailed: Pathological and physiological effects of a multifunctional developmental gene.
PMID: 37830136

Abstract:
Engrailed-1 (EN1) is a developmental gene that encodes En1, a highly conserved transcription factor involved in regionalization during early embryogenesis and in the later maintenance of normal neurons. After birth, EN1 still plays a role in the development and physiology of the body; for example, it exerts a protective effect on midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, and loss of EN1 causes mDA neurons in the ventral midbrain to gradually die approximately 6â€‰weeks after birth, resulting in motor and nonmotor symptoms similar to those observed in Parkinson's disease. Notably, EN1 has been identified as a possible susceptibility gene for idiopathic Parkinson's disease in humans. EN1 is involved in the processes of wound-healing scar production and tissue and organ fibrosis. Additionally, EN1 can lead to tumorigenesis and thus provides a target for the treatment of some tumors. In this review, we summarize the effects of EN1 on embryonic organ development, describe the consequences of the deletion or overexpression of the EN1 gene, and discuss the pathways in which EN1 is involved. We hope to clarify the role of EN1 as a developmental gene and present potential therapeutic targets for diseases involving the EN1 gene.
