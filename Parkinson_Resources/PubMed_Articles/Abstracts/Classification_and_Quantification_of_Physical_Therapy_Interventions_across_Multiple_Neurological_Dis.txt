Title: Classification and Quantification of Physical Therapy Interventions across Multiple Neurological Disorders: An Italian Multicenter Network.
PMID: 37892621

Abstract:
Despite their relevance in neurorehabilitation, physical therapy (PT) goals and interventions are poorly described, compromising a proper understanding of PT effectiveness in everyday clinical practice. Thus, this paper aims to describe the prevalence of PT goals and interventions in people with neurological disorders, along with the participants' clinical features, setting characteristics of the clinical units involved, and PT impact on outcome measures. A multicenter longitudinal observational study involving hospitals and rehabilitation centers across Italy has been conducted. We recruited people with stroke (<i>n</i> = 119), multiple sclerosis (<i>n</i> = 48), and Parkinson's disease (<i>n</i> = 35) who underwent the PT sessions foreseen by the National Healthcare System. Clinical outcomes were administered before and after the intervention, and for each participant the physical therapists completed a semi-structured interview to report the goals and interventions of the PT sessions. Results showed that the most relevant PT goals were related to the ICF activities with "walking" showing the highest prevalence. The most used interventions aimed at improving walking performance, followed by those aimed at improving organ/body system functioning, while interventions targeting the cognitive-affective and educational aspects have been poorly considered. Considering PT effectiveness, 83 participants experienced a clinically significant improvement in the outcome measures assessing gait and balance functions.
