Title: Hair Loss: A Well-Known Yet Understudied Symptom in Parkinson's Disease Patients During Dopaminergic Therapy.
PMID: 37748925

Abstract:
Hair loss has been reported to occur during dopaminergic therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease. The mechanism by which dopaminergic therapy induces hair loss is not well understood. Dopamine receptors are present in the hair follicle, where they regulate melanin production. However, the role of dopamine receptors in hair growth is still not well understood. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of hair loss and identify factors associated with complaints of hair loss in patients with Parkinson's disease.
