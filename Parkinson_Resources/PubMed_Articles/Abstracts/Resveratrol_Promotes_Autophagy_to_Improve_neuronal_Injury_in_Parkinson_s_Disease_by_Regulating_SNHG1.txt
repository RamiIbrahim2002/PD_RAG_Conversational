PMID: 37626481

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is seriously threatening the health and life quality of the elderly, who have a high incidence and high disability rate. Resveratrol (RES) was reported to play a protective role in PD. However, the functions and potential mechanism of RES in PD remain unclear, which need to be further explored.
