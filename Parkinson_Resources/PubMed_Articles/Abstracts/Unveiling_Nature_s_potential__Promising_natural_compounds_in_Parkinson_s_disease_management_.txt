Title: Unveiling Nature's potential: Promising natural compounds in Parkinson's disease management.
PMID: 37633805

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the exact etiology of PD remains elusive, growing evidence suggests a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors in its development. Despite advances in pharmacological interventions, current treatments primarily focus on managing symptoms rather than altering the disease's underlying course. In recent years, natural phytocompounds have emerged as a promising avenue for PD management. Phytochemicals derived from plants, such as phenolic acids, flavones, phenols, flavonoids, polyphenols, saponins, terpenes, alkaloids, and amino acids, have been extensively studied for their potential neuroprotective effects. These bioactive compounds possess a wide range of therapeutic properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-aggregation activities, which may counteract the neurodegenerative processes in PD. This comprehensive review delves into the pathophysiology of PD, with a specific focus on the roles of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and protein malfunction in disease pathogenesis. The review collates a wealth of evidence from preclinical studies and in vitro experiments, highlighting the potential of various phytochemicals in attenuating dopaminergic neuron degeneration, reducing Î±-synuclein aggregation, and modulating neuroinflammatory responses. Prominent among the natural compounds studied are curcumin, resveratrol, coenzyme Q10, and omega-3 fatty acids, which have demonstrated neuroprotective effects in experimental models of PD. Additionally, flavonoids like baicalein, luteolin, quercetin, and nobiletin, and alkaloids such as berberine and physostigmine, show promise in mitigating PD-associated pathologies. This review emphasizes the need for further research through controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of these natural compounds in PD management. Although preclinical evidence is compelling, the translation of these findings into effective therapies for PD necessitates robust clinical investigation. Rigorous evaluation of pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and potential drug interactions is imperative to pave the way for evidence-based treatment strategies. With the rising interest in natural alternatives and the potential for synergistic effects with conventional therapies, this review serves as a comprehensive resource for pharmaceutical industries, researchers, and clinicians seeking novel therapeutic approaches to combat PD. Harnessing the therapeutic potential of these natural phytocompounds may hold the key to improving the quality of life for PD patients and moving towards disease-modifying therapies in the future.
