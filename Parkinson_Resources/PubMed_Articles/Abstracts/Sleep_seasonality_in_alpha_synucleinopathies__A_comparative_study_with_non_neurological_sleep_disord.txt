Title: Sleep seasonality in alpha-synucleinopathies: A comparative study with non-neurological sleep disorder patients.
PMID: 37839275

Abstract:
It is unknown if seasonal variation in daylight affects sleep in patients with alpha-synucleinopathies. Our objectives were to assess month of the year related changes in polysomnography (PSG) data in patients with Parkinson 's disease (PD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) and isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD).
