Title: Static posturography analysis for postural instability in patients with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37873603

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is initially characterized by a rigid-akinetic syndrome and later by the development of postural instability. This condition often leads to balance impairments, potentially resulting in postural deformities and foot asymmetry. This study aimed to assess balance changes in PD patients.
