Title: Levodopa-induced dyskinesia in early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) associates with glucocerebrosidase mutation: A next-generation sequencing study in EOPD patients in Thailand.
PMID: 37906549

Abstract:
With the benefit of using next-generation sequencing (NGS), our aim was to examine the prevalence of known monogenic causes in early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) patients in Thailand. The association between clinical features, such as levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), and genotypes were also explored.
