Title: Discovery of Nedd4 auto-ubiquitination inhibitors.
PMID: 37749144

Abstract:
E3 ubiquitin ligases are critical to the protein degradation pathway by catalyzing the final step in protein ubiquitination by mediating ubiquitin transfer from E2 enzymes to target proteins. Nedd4 is a HECT domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase with a wide range of protein targets, the dysregulation of which has been implicated in myriad pathologies, including cancer and Parkinson's disease. Towards the discovery of compounds disrupting the auto-ubiquitination activity of Nedd4, we developed and optimized a TR-FRET assay for high-throughput screening. Through selective screening of a library of potentially covalent compounds, compounds 25 and 81 demonstrated apparent IC<sub>50</sub> values of 52 µM and 31 µM, respectively. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis confirmed that 25 and 81 were covalently bound to Nedd4 cysteine residues (Cys182 and Cys867). In addition, 81 also adducted to Cys627. Auto-ubiquitination assays of Nedd4 mutants featuring alanine substitutions for each of these cysteines suggested that the mode of inhibition of these compounds occurs through blocking the catalytic Cys867. The discovery of these inhibitors could enable the development of therapeutics for various diseases caused by Nedd4 E3 ligase dysregulation.
