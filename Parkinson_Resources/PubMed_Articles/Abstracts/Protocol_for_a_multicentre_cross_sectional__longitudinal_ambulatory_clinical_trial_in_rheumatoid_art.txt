Title: Protocol for a multicentre cross-sectional, longitudinal ambulatory clinical trial in rheumatoid arthritis and Parkinson's disease patients analysing the relation between the gut microbiome, fasting and immune status in Germany (ExpoBiome).
PMID: 37597865

Abstract:
Chronic inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD) have recently been associated with a decreased diversity in the gut microbiome, emerging as key driver of various diseases. The specific interactions between gut-borne microorganisms and host pathophysiology remain largely unclear. The microbiome can be modulated by interventions comprising nutrition.The aim of our clinical study is to (1) examine effects of prolonged fasting (PF) and time-restricted eating (TRE) on the outcome parameters and the immunophenotypes of RA and PD with (2) special consideration of microbial taxa and molecules associated with changes expected in (1), and (3) identify factors impacting the disease course and treatment by in-depth screening of microorganisms and molecules in personalised HuMiX gut-on-chip models, to identify novel targets for anti-inflammatory therapy.
