Title: Human Motor System-Based Biohybrid Robot-On-a-Chip for Drug Evaluation of Neurodegenerative Disease.
PMID: 38036423

Abstract:
Biohybrid robots have been developed for biomedical applications and industrial robotics. However, the biohybrid robots have limitations to be applied in neurodegenerative disease research due to the absence of a central nervous system. In addition, the organoids-on-a-chip has not yet been able to replicate the physiological function of muscle movement in the human motor system, which is essential for evaluating the accuracy of the drugs used for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Here, a human motor system-based biohybrid robot-on-a-chip composed of a brain organoid, multi-motor neuron spheroids, and muscle bundle on solid substrateis proposed to evaluate the drug effect on neurodegenerative diseases for the first time. The electrophysiological signals from the cerebral organoid induced the muscle bundle movement through motor neuron spheroids. To evaluate the drug effect on Parkinson's disease (PD), a patient-derived midbrain organoid is generated and incorporated into a biohybrid robot-on-a-chip. The drug effect on PD is successfully evaluated by measuring muscle bundle movement. The muscle bundle movement of PD patient-derived midbrain organoid-based biohybrid robot-on-a-chip is increased from 4.5 ± 0.99 µm to 18.67 ± 2.25 µm in response to levodopa. The proposed human motor system-based biohybrid robot-on-a-chip can serve as a standard biohybrid robot model for drug evaluation.
