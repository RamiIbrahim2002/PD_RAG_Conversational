PMID: 38096441

Abstract:
Implantable neural stimulation devices are becoming prevalent in bioelectronic medicine for the precise treatment of various clinical diseases. Nevertheless, the limited lifespan and buckling size of the implanted devices remain significant obstacles for chronic clinical application. In this study, we developed an ultrasound-driven battery-free neurostimulator based on a high-performance mini-sized nanogenerator and demonstrated its successful application for the deep-brain-stimulation (DBS) therapy of Parkinson's disease in a rat model. This soft piezoelectric-triboelectric hybrid nanogenerators (PTNG) are made of porous thin-films of molecular piezoelectric materials, which have great advantages of facile, scalable, low-temperature, and flexible processing. Without any bucky accessory control circuits, the subcutaneously implanted soft PTNG can function as a wirelessly powered neurostimulator, allowing for the adjustment of stimulation parameters through external programmable ultrasound pulses. This DBS electroceutical application of energy-harvesting thin-film devices based on molecular piezoelectric materials provides valuable insight into the development of a soft high-performance bioelectronic device.
