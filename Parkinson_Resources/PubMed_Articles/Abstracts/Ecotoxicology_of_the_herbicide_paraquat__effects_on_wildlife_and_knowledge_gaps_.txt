Title: Ecotoxicology of the herbicide paraquat: effects on wildlife and knowledge gaps.
PMID: 37973658

Abstract:
Paraquat (PQ) is an organic herbicide introduced to the commercial market in 1962 and since linked to a variety of human health effects, including lung fibrosis, liver tumors, and Parkinson's disease. Although PQ is banned in the European Union, it is still frequently used in agricultural areas of the United States and Asia. The general mechanism of PQ's toxicity is the disruption of the redox cycle in cells. This mini-review summarizes our current understanding of PQ toxicity in non-target plants and animals. Among vertebrates, PQ sensitivity tends follow the pattern of fish > amphibians > mammals > birds. Aquatic plants are particularly vulnerable to PQ, with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from ~28-280 μg/L. A number of convenient but non-specific biomarkers have been identified for non-target species, including the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, histological changes in the gill structures of fish, and the upregulation of genes associated with the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase system. Significant literature gaps include a lack of data for environmentally realistic conditions (i.e., chronic, low concentration, multi-stressor), toxicity in reptiles, and population- and ecosystem-level effects. Although PQ is a useful herbicide, considering the many human and ecological health impacts, it may be time for regulators and the agricultural industry to reconsider its use.
