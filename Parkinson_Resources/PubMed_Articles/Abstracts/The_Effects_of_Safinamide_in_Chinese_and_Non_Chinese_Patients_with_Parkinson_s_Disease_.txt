PMID: 38070039

Abstract:
Ethnicity differences are an important determinant in the clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD), but they are not yet widely recognized, particularly regarding the response to dopaminergic medications. The aim of this paper is to analyze the efficacy and safety of safinamide in Chinese patients with PD in the pivotal studies SETTLE and XINDI compared to the non-Chinese population of the SETTLE trial.
