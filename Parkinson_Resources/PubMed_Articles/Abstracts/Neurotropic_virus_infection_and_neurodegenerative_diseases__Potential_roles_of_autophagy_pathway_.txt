Title: Neurotropic virus infection and neurodegenerative diseases: Potential roles of autophagy pathway.
PMID: 38082503

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) constitute a group of disorders characterized by the progressive deterioration of nervous system functionality. Currently, the precise etiological factors responsible for NDs remain incompletely elucidated, although it is probable that a combination of aging, genetic predisposition, and environmental stressors participate in this process. Accumulating evidence indicates that viral infections, especially neurotropic viruses, can contribute to the onset and progression of NDs. In this review, emerging evidence supporting the association between viral infection and NDs is summarized, and how the autophagy pathway mediated by viral infection can cause pathological aggregation of cellular proteins associated with various NDs is discussed. Furthermore, autophagy-related genes (ARGs) involved in Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) infection and NDs are analyzed, and whether these genes could link HSV-1 infection to NDs is discussed. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying NDs is critical for developing targeted therapeutic approaches that prevent the onset and slow the progression of NDs.
