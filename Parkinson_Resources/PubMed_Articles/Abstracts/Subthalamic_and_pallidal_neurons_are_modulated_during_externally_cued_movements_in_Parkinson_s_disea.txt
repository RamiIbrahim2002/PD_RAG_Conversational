Title: Subthalamic and pallidal neurons are modulated during externally cued movements in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38135193

Abstract:
External sensory cues can reduce freezing of gait in people with Parkinson's disease (PD), yet the role of the basal ganglia in these movements is unclear. We used microelectrode recordings to examine modulations in single unit (SU) and oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) during auditory-cued rhythmic pedaling movements of the feet. We tested five blocks of increasing cue frequencies (1 Hz, 1.5 Hz, 2 Hz, 2.5 Hz, and 3 Hz) in 24 people with PD undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus internus (GPi). Single unit firing and beta band LFPs (13-30 Hz) in response to movement onsets or cue onsets were examined. We found that the timing accuracy of foot pedaling decreased with faster cue frequencies. Increasing cue frequencies also attenuated firing rates in both STN and GPi neurons. Peak beta power in the GPi and STN showed different responses to the task. GPi beta power showed persistent suppression with fast cues and phasic modulation with slow cues. STN beta power showed enhanced beta synchronization following movement. STN beta power also correlated with rate of pedaling. Overall, we showed task-related responses in the GPi and STN during auditory-cued movements with differential roles in sensory and motor control. The results suggest a role for both input and output basal ganglia nuclei in auditory rhythmic pacing of gait-like movements in PD.
