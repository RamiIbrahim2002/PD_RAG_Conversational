Title: Abnormalities in Copper Status Associated with an Elevated Risk of Parkinson's Phenotype Development.
PMID: 37759957

Abstract:
In the last 15 years, among the many reasons given for the development of idiopathic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD), copper imbalance has been identified as a factor, and PD is often referred to as a copper-mediated disorder. More than 640 papers have been devoted to the relationship between PD and copper status in the blood, which include the following markers: total copper concentration, enzymatic ceruloplasmin (Cp) concentration, Cp protein level, and non-ceruloplasmin copper level. Most studies measure only one of these markers. Therefore, the existence of a correlation between copper status and the development of PD is still debated. Based on data from the published literature, meta-analysis, and our own research, it is clear that there is a connection between the development of PD symptoms and the number of copper atoms, which are weakly associated with the ceruloplasmin molecule. In this work, the link between the risk of developing PD and various inborn errors related to copper metabolism, leading to decreased levels of oxidase ceruloplasmin in the circulation and cerebrospinal fluid, is discussed.
