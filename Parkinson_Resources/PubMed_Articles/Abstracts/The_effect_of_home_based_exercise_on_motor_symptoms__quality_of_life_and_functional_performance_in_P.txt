Title: The effect of home-based exercise on motor symptoms, quality of life and functional performance in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PMID: 38114897

Abstract:
Faced with the lack of physical activity caused by mandatory home isolation during special periods and patients' inconvenience in carrying out professionally supervised exercise, many home-based exercise programs have been developed. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of home-based exercise on measures of motor symptoms, quality of life and functional performance in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.
