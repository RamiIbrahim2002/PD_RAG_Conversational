Title: Early Onset Parkinson Syndrome, Type A Aortic Aneurysm and Noncompaction Associated With the Novel Variant c.2225C>T in MYH11: A Case Report.
PMID: 37954829

Abstract:
Aortic aneurysm, left ventricular noncompaction, and early onset Parkinson syndrome have not been reported in association with <i>MYH11</i> variants. The patient is a 44-year-old male who developed a progressive ascending aortic aneurysm at age 30, requiring aortic repair at the age of 40. In addition, he developed Parkinson syndrome at the age of 37. He also suffered from myopia, hypothyroidism, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, pre-diabetes, hyperbilirubinemia, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), and muscle cramps. Echocardiography and cardiac MRI showed left ventricular noncompaction. Genetic analysis revealed the novel heterozygous variant c.2225C>T (p.Ala742Val) in <i>MYH11</i>. Family history was positive for arterial hypertension (mother), carcinoma (brother), and diabetes (sister, father). There was consanguinity between the parents. With appropriate treatment, Parkinson syndrome and cardiac anomalies remained stable and there were no complications due to noncompaction or aortic repair. Considering that embryonic vascularisation may be involved in the pathophysiology of noncompaction and that <i>MYH11</i> is expressed in the myocardium, a causal relationship between the <i>MYH11</i> variant and noncompaction is conceivable. In conclusion, this is the first case showing an aortic aneurysm associated with noncompaction and Parkinson syndrome in a carrier of the novel, heterozygous variant c.2225C>T in <i>MYH11</i>. Carriers of <i>MYH11</i> variants should be prospectively and systematically screened for multisystem diseases as soon as the genetic defect is discovered in order not to delay any necessary treatment. First-degree relatives should be screened for the <i>MYH11</i> variant of a family member to track the trait of inheritance and confirm its pathogenicity.
