Title: Monitoring and Predicting Health Status in Neurological Patients: The ALAMEDA Data Collection Protocol.
PMID: 37830693

Abstract:
(1) Objective: We explore the predictive power of a novel stream of patient data, combining wearable devices and patient reported outcomes (PROs), using an AI-first approach to classify the health status of Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and stroke patients (collectively named PMSS). (2) Background: Recent studies acknowledge the burden of neurological disorders on patients and on the healthcare systems managing them. To address this, effort is invested in the digital transformation of health provisioning for PMSS patients. (3) Methods: We introduce the data collection journey within the ALAMEDA project, which continuously collects PRO data for a year through mobile applications and supplements them with data from minimally intrusive wearable devices (accelerometer bracelet, IMU sensor belt, ground force measuring insoles, and sleep mattress) worn for 1-2 weeks at each milestone. We present the data collection schedule and its feasibility, the mapping of medical predictor variables to wearable device capabilities and mobile application functionality. (4) Results: A novel combination of wearable devices and smartphone applications required for the desired analysis of motor, sleep, emotional and quality-of-life outcomes is introduced. AI-first analysis methods are presented that aim to uncover the prediction capability of diverse longitudinal and cross-sectional setups (in terms of standard medical test targets). Mobile application development and usage schedule facilitates the retention of patient engagement and compliance with the study protocol.
