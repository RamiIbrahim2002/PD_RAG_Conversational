Title: CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL EFFECT OF MPTP VIA DOSE-DEPENDENT MAGNESIUM MODULATION.
PMID: 37601708

Abstract:
Recent studies suggested that MPTP could cause gastrointestinal motility deficits additionally to its nonconclusive and controverted effects on the CNS (behavior and brain oxidative stress) in rats. A possible interaction between MPTP typical impairments and magnesium modulatory potential was previously suggested, as magnesium role was described in neuroprotection, gastrointestinal function, and oxidative stress.
