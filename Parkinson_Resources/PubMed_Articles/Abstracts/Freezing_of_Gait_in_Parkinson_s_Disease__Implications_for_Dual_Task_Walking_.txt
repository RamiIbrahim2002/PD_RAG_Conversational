Title: Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease: Implications for Dual-Task Walking.
PMID: 37574744

Abstract:
The simultaneous completion of multiple tasks (dual-tasking, DT) often leads to poorer task performance (DT cost, DTC). People with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) exhibit difficulty with DT, and DTC may be particularly pronounced in PwPD with freezing of gait (FOG).
