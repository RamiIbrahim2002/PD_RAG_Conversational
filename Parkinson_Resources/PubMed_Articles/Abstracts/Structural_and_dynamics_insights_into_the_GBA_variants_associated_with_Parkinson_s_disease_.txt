Title: Structural and dynamics insights into the GBA variants associated with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37434319

Abstract:
The <i>GBA1</i> gene encodes for the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which maintains glycosphingolipid homeostasis and regulates the autophagy process. Genomic variants of <i>GBA1</i> are associated with Goucher disease; however, several heterozygous variants of GBA (E326K, T369M, N370S, L444P) are frequent high-risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). The underlying mechanism of these variants has been revealed through functional and patient-centered research, but the structural and dynamical aspects of these variants have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In the current study, we used a thorough computational method to pinpoint the structural changes that GBA underwent because of genomic variants and drug binding mechanisms. According to our findings, PD-linked nsSNP variants of GBA showed structural variation and abnormal dynamics when compared to wild-typ. The docking analysis demonstrated that the mutants E326K, N370S, and L444P have higher binding affinities for Ambroxol. Root means square deviation (RMSD), Root mean square fluctuation analysis (RMSF), and MM-GBSA analysis confirmed that the Ambroxol are more stable in the binding site of N370S and L444P, and that their binding affinities are stronger as compared to the wild-type and T369M variants of GBA. The evaluation of hydrogen bonds and the calculation of the free binding energy provided additional evidence in favor of this conclusion. When docked with Ambroxol, GBA demonstrated an increase in binding affinity and catalytic activity. Understanding the therapeutic efficacy and potential against the aforementioned changes in the GBA will be beneficial in order to use more efficient methods for developing novel drugs.
