Title: Probiotic Influences on Motor Skills: A Review.
PMID: 37550907

Abstract:
The effects of probiotics have mostly been shown to be favorable on measures of anxiety and stress. More recent experiments indicate single- and multi-strain probiotics in treating motorrelated diseases. Initial studies in patients with Parkinson's disease and Prader-Willi syndrome are concordant with this hypothesis. In addition, probiotics improved motor coordination in normal animals and models of Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injury as well as grip strength in hepatic encephalopathy. Further studies should delineate the most optimal bacterial profile under each condition.
