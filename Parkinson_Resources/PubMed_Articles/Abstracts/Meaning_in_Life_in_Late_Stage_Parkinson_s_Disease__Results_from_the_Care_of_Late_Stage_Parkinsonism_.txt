PMID: 38049708

Abstract:
The Care of Late-Stage Parkinsonism (CLaSP) study is a longitudinal, multicentre, prospective cohort study to assess the needs and provision of care for people with late-stage Parkinson's disease and their caregivers in six European countries. As a cross-sectional study within the CLaSP study, 509 people with Parkinson's disease completed the "Schedule-for-Meaning-in-Life-Evaluation" (SMiLE) questionnaire. We compared the results to those of a representative sample of healthy participants (n = 856). People with late-stage Parkinson's disease reported family, partnership and spirituality as the greatest areas of importance. Overall, they had lower SMiLE indices compared to healthy participants. People with late-stage Parkinson's disease rated the importance of core meaning in life areas (namely family, social relations and health) as significantly lower than the representative cohort and they also rated satisfaction as significantly lower in most areas. In conclusion, people with late-stage Parkinson's disease do have areas where they can find meaning, such as family, partnership and spirituality. However, they indicate a lack of fulfilment of their individual MiL, reflected by low satisfaction rates in the majority of meaning in life categories. The need for spiritual support for people with Parkinson's disease indicates the important role of chaplains to help people with Parkinson's disease maintain meaning in life.
