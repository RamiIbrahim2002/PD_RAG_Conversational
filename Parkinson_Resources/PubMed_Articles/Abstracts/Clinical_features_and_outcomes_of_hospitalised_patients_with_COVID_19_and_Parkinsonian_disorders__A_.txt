PMID: 37523365

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease has been identified as a risk factor for severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. However, whether the significant high risk of death from COVID-19 in people with Parkinson's disease is specific to the disease itself or driven by other concomitant and known risk factors such as comorbidities, age, and frailty remains unclear.
