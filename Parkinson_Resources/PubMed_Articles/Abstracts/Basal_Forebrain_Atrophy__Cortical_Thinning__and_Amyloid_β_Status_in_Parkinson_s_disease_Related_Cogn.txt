Title: Basal Forebrain Atrophy, Cortical Thinning, and Amyloid-Î² Status in Parkinson's disease-Related Cognitive Decline.
PMID: 37492892

Abstract:
Degeneration of the cortically-projecting cholinergic basal forebrain (cBF) is a well-established pathologic correlate of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD). In Alzheimer's disease (AD) the effect of cBF degeneration on cognitive decline was found to be mediated by parallel atrophy of denervated cortical areas.
