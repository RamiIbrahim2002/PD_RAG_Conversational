Title: Microglia Mediate Contact-Independent Neuronal Network Remodeling via Secreted Neuraminidase-3 Associated with Extracellular Vesicles.
PMID: 38033791

Abstract:
Neurons communicate with each other through electrochemical transmission at synapses. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, modulate this communication through a variety of contact-dependent and -independent means. Microglial secretion of active sialidase enzymes upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli is one unexplored mechanism of modulation. Recent work from our lab showed that treatment of neurons with bacterial sialidases disrupts neuronal network connectivity. Here, we find that activated microglia secrete neuraminidase-3 (Neu3) associated with fusogenic extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, we show that Neu3 mediates contact-independent disruption of neuronal network synchronicity through neuronal glycocalyx remodeling. We observe that <i>NEU3</i> is transcriptionally upregulated upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli and that a genetic knockout of <i>NEU3</i> abrogates the sialidase activity of inflammatory microglial secretions. Moreover, we demonstrate that Neu3 is associated with a subpopulation of extracellular vesicles, possibly exosomes, that are secreted by microglia upon inflammatory insult. Finally, we demonstrate that Neu3 is necessary and sufficient to both desialylate neurons and decrease neuronal network connectivity. These results implicate Neu3 in remodeling of the glycocalyx leading to aberrant network-level activity of neurons, with implications in neuroinflammatory diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
