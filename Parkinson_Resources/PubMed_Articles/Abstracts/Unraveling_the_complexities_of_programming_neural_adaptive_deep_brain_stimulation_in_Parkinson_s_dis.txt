Title: Unraveling the complexities of programming neural adaptive deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38094147

Abstract:
Over the past three decades, deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) has been applied in a continuous open loop fashion, unresponsive to changes in a given patient's state or symptoms over the course of a day. Advances in recent neurostimulator technology enable the possibility for closed loop adaptive DBS (aDBS) for PD as a treatment option in the near future in which stimulation adjusts in a demand-based manner. Although aDBS offers great clinical potential for treatment of motor symptoms, it also brings with it the need for better understanding how to implement it in order to maximize its benefits. In this perspective, we outline considerations for programing several key parameters for aDBS based on our experience across several aDBS-capable research neurostimulators. At its core, aDBS hinges on successful identification of relevant biomarkers that can be measured reliably in real-time working in cohesion with a control policy that governs stimulation adaption. However, auxiliary parameters such as the window in which stimulation is allowed to adapt, as well as the rate it changes, can be just as impactful on performance and vary depending on the control policy and patient. A standardize protocol for programming aDBS will be crucial to ensuring its effective application in clinical practice.
