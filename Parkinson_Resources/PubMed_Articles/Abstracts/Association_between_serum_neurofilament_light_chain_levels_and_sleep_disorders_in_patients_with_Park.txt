PMID: 37437874

Abstract:
This study aimed to investigate the levels of serum neurofilament light chain (NFL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD patients with sleep disorders (PD-SD), as well as the relationship between these proteins and sleep disorders in PD patients.
