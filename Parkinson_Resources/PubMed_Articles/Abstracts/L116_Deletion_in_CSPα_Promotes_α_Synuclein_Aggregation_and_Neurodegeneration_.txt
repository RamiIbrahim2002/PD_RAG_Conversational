Title: L116 Deletion in CSPα Promotes α-Synuclein Aggregation and Neurodegeneration.
PMID: 37566176

Abstract:
Parkinsonism is a clinical syndrome that is caused by Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report a patient who exhibited progressive parkinsonism, epilepsy, and cognitive impairment and was diagnosed with adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (ANCLs). The patient carries a mutation (p.Leu116 del) in the DNAJC5 gene that encodes cysteine string protein (CSPα). Since the patient shows typical parkinsonism and loss of dopamine transporter in the striatum, we investigated the effect of wild-type and L116del mutant CSPα on the aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) and neurotoxicity in vitro. Overexpression of wild-type CSPα attenuated the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and aggregation of α-syn induced by α-syn fibrils. Moreover, wild-type CSPα inhibits oxidative stress and cell apoptosis and rescues inefficient SNARE complex formation induced by α-syn fibrils in SH-SY5Y cells. However, these protective effects of CSPα were abolished by the L116del mutation. Collectively, these results indicate that L116 deletion in CSPα promotes α-syn pathology and neurotoxicity. Boosting CSPα may be therapeutically useful for treating synucleinopathies.
