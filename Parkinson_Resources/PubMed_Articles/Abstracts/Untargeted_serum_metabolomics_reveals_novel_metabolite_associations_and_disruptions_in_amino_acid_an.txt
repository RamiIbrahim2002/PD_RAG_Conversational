Title: Untargeted serum metabolomics reveals novel metabolite associations and disruptions in amino acid and lipid metabolism in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38115046

Abstract:
Untargeted high-resolution metabolomic profiling provides simultaneous measurement of thousands of metabolites. Metabolic networks based on these data can help uncover disease-related perturbations across interconnected pathways.
