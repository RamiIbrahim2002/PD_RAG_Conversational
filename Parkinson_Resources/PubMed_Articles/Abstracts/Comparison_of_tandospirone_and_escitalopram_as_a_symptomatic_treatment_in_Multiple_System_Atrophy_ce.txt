PMID: 37907036

Abstract:
Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by autonomic failure and motor dysfunction in parkinsonism and/or cerebellar ataxia. Patients with MSA usually present with depression and anxiety symptoms. This observational study of patients with MSA-cerebellar subtype (MSA-C) with subthreshold depression/anxiety symptoms aimed to compare the efficacy of escitalopram oxalate (an antidepressant drug) and tandospirone citrate (an anxiolytic drug).
