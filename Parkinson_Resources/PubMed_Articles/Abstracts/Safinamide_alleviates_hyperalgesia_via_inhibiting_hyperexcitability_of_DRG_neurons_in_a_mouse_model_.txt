Title: Safinamide alleviates hyperalgesia via inhibiting hyperexcitability of DRG neurons in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38042302

Abstract:
Pain is a widespread non-motor symptom that presents significant treatment challenges in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Safinamide, a new drug recently introduced for PD treatment, has demonstrated analgesic effects on pain in PD patients, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate the analgesic and anti-PD effect of safinamide, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model was used, and rasagiline as positive control on motor symptoms. Notably, only safinamide alleviated hyperalgesia in MPTP mice. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons revealed hyperexcitability in MPTP mice, which safinamide counteracted in a concentration-dependent manner. The voltage clamp further demonstrated that sodium current in DRG neurons of MPTP mice was enhanced and safinamide reduced sodium current density. RT-qPCR identified upregulated Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 transcripts (Scn9a and Scn10a) in DRG neurons of MPTP mice. Our results suggest that safinamide could relieve hyperalgesia by inhibiting DRG neuron hyperexcitability in MPTP mice.
