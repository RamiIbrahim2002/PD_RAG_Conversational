Title: Core clock gene, <i>Bmal1</i>, is required for optimal second-level interval production.
PMID: 38125761

Abstract:
Perception and production of second-level temporal intervals are critical in several behavioral and cognitive processes, including adaptive anticipation, motor control, and social communication. These processes are impaired in several neurological and psychological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Although evidence indicates that second-level interval timing exhibit circadian patterns, it remains unclear whether the core clock machinery controls the circadian pattern of interval timing. To investigate the role of core clock molecules in interval timing capacity, we devised a behavioral assay called the interval timing task to examine prospective motor interval timing ability. In this task, the mouse produces two separate nose pokes in a pretrained second-level interval to obtain a sucrose solution as a reward. We discovered that interval perception in wild-type mice displayed a circadian pattern, with the best performance observed during the late active phase. To investigate whether the core molecular clock is involved in the circadian control of interval timing, we employed <i>Bmal1</i> knockout mice (BKO) in the interval timing task<b>.</b> The interval production of BKO did not display any difference between early and late active phase, without reaching the optimal interval production level observed in wild-type. In summary, we report that the core clock gene <i>Bmal1</i> is required for the optimal performance of prospective motor timing typically observed during the late part of the active period.
