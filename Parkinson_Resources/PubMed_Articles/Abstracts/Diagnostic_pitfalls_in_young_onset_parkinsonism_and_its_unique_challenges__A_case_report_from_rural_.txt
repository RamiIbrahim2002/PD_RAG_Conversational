PMID: 37663151

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from the loss of dopamine-secreting neurons present in the substantia nigra of the brain. Parkinson's disease is classified as early-onset and late-onset disease based on the time of its presentation. Since young patients with Parkinson's disease have an atypical clinical presentation and have to deal with their careers, raising families, or both at the time of diagnosis and also have a higher risk of drug-related side effects, it poses unique challenges for the patient, clinical team, and community. We present the case of a 40-year-old female with young onset Parkinson's disease from rural Nepal and the challenges faced during and after the disease in a resource-limited setting.
