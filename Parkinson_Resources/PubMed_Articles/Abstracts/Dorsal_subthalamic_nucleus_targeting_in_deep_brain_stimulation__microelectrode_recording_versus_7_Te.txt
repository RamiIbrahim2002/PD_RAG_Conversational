Title: Dorsal subthalamic nucleus targeting in deep brain stimulation: microelectrode recording versus 7-Tesla connectivity.
PMID: 38025271

Abstract:
Connectivity-derived 7-Tesla MRI segmentation and intraoperative microelectrode recording can both assist subthalamic nucleus targeting for deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease. It remains unclear whether deep brain stimulation electrodes placed in the 7-Tesla MRI segmented subdivision with predominant projections to cortical motor areas (hyperdirect pathway) achieve superior motor improvement and whether microelectrode recording can accurately distinguish the motor subdivision. In 25 patients with Parkinson's disease, deep brain stimulation electrodes were evaluated for being inside or outside the predominantly motor-connected subthalamic nucleus (motor-connected subthalamic nucleus or non-motor-connected subthalamic nucleus, respectively) based on 7-Tesla MRI connectivity segmentation. Hemi-body motor improvement (Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III) and microelectrode recording characteristics of multi- and single-unit activities were compared between groups. Deep brain stimulation electrodes placed in the motor-connected subthalamic nucleus resulted in higher hemi-body motor improvement, compared with electrodes placed in the non-motor-connected subthalamic nucleus (80% versus 52%, <i>P</i> < 0.0001). Multi-unit activity was found slightly higher in the motor-connected subthalamic nucleus versus the non-motor-connected subthalamic nucleus (<i>P</i> < 0.001, receiver operating characteristic 0.63); single-unit activity did not differ between groups. Deep brain stimulation in the connectivity-derived 7-Tesla MRI subthalamic nucleus motor segment produced a superior clinical outcome; however, microelectrode recording did not accurately distinguish this subdivision within the subthalamic nucleus.
