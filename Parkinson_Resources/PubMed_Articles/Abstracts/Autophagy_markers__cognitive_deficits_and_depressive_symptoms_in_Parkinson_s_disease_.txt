Title: Autophagy markers, cognitive deficits and depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37801108

Abstract:
Depressive symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). The relationships between autophagy and PD or depression have been documented. However, no studies explored the role of autophagy markers associated with depressive symptoms in PD. Our study aimed to investigate the relationships between autophagy markers, cognitive impairments and depressive symptoms in PD patients. A total of 163 PD patients aged 50-80 years were recruited. Plasma concentrations of autophagy markers (LC3-I, LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1) and glycolipid parameters were measured. Depressive symptoms, cognitive impairments, and motor function were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HAMD-17), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Rating Scale Part III (MDS-UPDRS-III), respectively. There were no significant differences between depressed and non-depressed PD patients for LC3-I, LC3-II, LC3-II/LC3-I and p62/SQSTM1. After controlling confounding variables, LC3-II/LC3-I showed an independent relationship with depressive symptoms in PD patients (Beta = 10.082, t = 2.483, p = 0.014). Moreover, in depressive PD patients, p62/SQSTM1 was associated with MoCA score (Beta = - 0.002, t = - 2.380, p = 0.020); Further, p62/SQSTM1 was related to naming ability; in addition, p62/SQSTM1 was independently associated with delayed recall (Beta = - 0.001, t = - 2.452, p = 0.017). LC3-II/LC3-I was related to depressive symptoms in PD patients. In depressive PD patients, p62/SQSTM1 was associated with cognitive function, especially naming ability and delayed recall.
