Title: Multiancestry analysis of the HLA locus in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases uncovers a shared adaptive immune response mediated by <i>HLA-DRB1*04</i> subtypes.
PMID: 37643212

Abstract:
Across multiancestry groups, we analyzed Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) associations in over 176,000 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) versus controls. We demonstrate that the two diseases share the same protective association at the HLA locus. HLA-specific fine-mapping showed that hierarchical protective effects of <i>HLA-DRB1</i>*04 subtypes best accounted for the association, strongest with <i>HLA-DRB1</i>*04:04 and <i>HLA-DRB1</i>*04:07, and intermediary with <i>HLA-DRB1</i>*04:01 and <i>HLA-DRB1</i>*04:03. The same signal was associated with decreased neurofibrillary tangles in postmortem brains and was associated with reduced tau levels in cerebrospinal fluid and to a lower extent with increased AÎ²42. Protective <i>HLA-DRB1</i>*04 subtypes strongly bound the aggregation-prone tau PHF6 sequence, however only when acetylated at a lysine (K311), a common posttranslational modification central to tau aggregation. An <i>HLA-DRB1</i>*04-mediated adaptive immune response decreases PD and AD risks, potentially by acting against tau, offering the possibility of therapeutic avenues.
