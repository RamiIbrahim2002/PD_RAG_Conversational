Title: The Increasing Prevalence of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder with Parkinson's Disease Progression: A Polysomnography-Supported Study.
PMID: 38094641

Abstract:
Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is proposed as an early diagnostic marker in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the frequency of RBD during the progression of PD in the advanced stages and identified potential risk factors for developing RBD earlier or later.
