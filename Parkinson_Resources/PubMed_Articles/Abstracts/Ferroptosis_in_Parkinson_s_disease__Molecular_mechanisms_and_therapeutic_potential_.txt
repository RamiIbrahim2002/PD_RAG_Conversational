Title: Ferroptosis in Parkinson's disease: Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential.
PMID: 37742785

Abstract:
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. While the exact mechanisms remain complex and multifaceted, several molecular pathways have been implicated in PD pathology, including accumulation of misfolded proteins, impaired mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, inflammation, elevated iron levels, etc. Overall, PD's molecular mechanisms involve a complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and cellular factors that disrupt cellular homeostasis, and ultimately lead to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Recently, emerging evidence highlights ferroptosis, an iron-dependent non-apoptotic cell death process, as a pivotal player in the advancement of PD. Notably, oligomeric α-synuclein (α-syn) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxides within cellular membranes, potentially triggering ferroptosis. The loss of dopamine, a hallmark of PD, could predispose neurons to ferroptotic vulnerability. This unique form of cell demise unveils fresh insights into PD pathogenesis, necessitating an exploration of the molecular intricacies connecting ferroptosis and PD progression. In this review, the molecular and regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis and their connection with the pathological processes of PD have been systematically summarized. Furthermore, the features of ferroptosis in PD animal models and clinical trials targeting ferroptosis as a therapeutic approach in PD patients' management are scrutinized.
