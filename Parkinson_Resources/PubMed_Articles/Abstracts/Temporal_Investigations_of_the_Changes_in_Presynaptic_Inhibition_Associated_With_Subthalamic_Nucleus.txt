Title: Temporal Investigations of the Changes in Presynaptic Inhibition Associated With Subthalamic Nucleus-Deep-Brain Stimulation.
PMID: 37488958

Abstract:
There are controversies regarding the role of presynaptic inhibition (PSI) in the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD). We sought to determine the involvement of PSI in DBS-related mechanisms and clinical correlates.
