Abstract:
Integration of multi-modal sensory inputs and modulation of motor outputs based on perceptual estimates is called Sensorimotor Integration (SMI). Optimal functioning of SMI is essential for perceiving the environment, modulating the motor outputs, and learning or modifying motor skills to suit the demands of the environment. Growing evidence suggests that patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD) may suffer from an impairment in SMI that contributes to perceptual deficits, leading to motor abnormalities. However, the exact nature of the SMI impairment is still unclear. This study uses a robot-assisted assessment tool to quantitatively characterize SMI impairments in PD patients and how they affect voluntary movements. A set of assessment tasks was developed using a robotic manipulandum equipped with a virtual-reality system. The sensory conditions of the virtual environment were varied to facilitate the assessment of SMI. A hundred PD patients (before and after medication) and forty-three control subjects completed the tasks under varying sensory conditions. The kinematic measures obtained from the robotic device were used to evaluate SMI. The findings reveal that across all sensory conditions, PD patients had 36% higher endpoint error, 38% higher direction error in reaching tasks, and 43% higher number of violations in tracing tasks than control subjects due to impairment in integrating sensory inputs. However, they still retained motor learning ability and the ability to modulate motor outputs. The medication worsened the SMI deficits as PD patients, after medication, performed worse than before medication when encountering dynamic sensory environments and exhibited impaired motor learning ability.
