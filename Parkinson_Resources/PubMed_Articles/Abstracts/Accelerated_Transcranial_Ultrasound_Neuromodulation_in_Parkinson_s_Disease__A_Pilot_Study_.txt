Title: Accelerated Transcranial Ultrasound Neuromodulation in Parkinson's Disease: A Pilot Study.
PMID: 37811802

Abstract:
Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (TUS) is a novel method for neuromodulation. We aimed to study the feasibilityÂ of stimulating the bilateral primary motor cortices (M1) with accelerated theta-burst TUS (a-tbTUS) on neurophysiologic and clinical outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD).
