Title: Plasma cytokines profile in patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease: a comparative study in terms of inflammation.
PMID: 38064237

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease inflict economic and health burdens on societies. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, is accompanied by progressive degradation of memory, decision-making, and judgment. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and loss of balance. Extensive research has pinpointed inflammation as a cause of the onset and progression of both diseases. However, it has not been confirmed which one is more formidable in terms of inflammation.
