Title: Neuromuscular assessment of force development, postural, and gait performance under cognitive-motor dual-tasking in healthy older adults and people with early Parkinson's disease: Study protocol for a cross-sectional Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) study.
PMID: 38009088

Abstract:
Neuromuscular dysfunction is common in older adults and more pronounced in neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease (PD), a complex set of factors often prevents the effective performance of activities of daily living that require intact and simultaneous performance of the motor and cognitive tasks.
