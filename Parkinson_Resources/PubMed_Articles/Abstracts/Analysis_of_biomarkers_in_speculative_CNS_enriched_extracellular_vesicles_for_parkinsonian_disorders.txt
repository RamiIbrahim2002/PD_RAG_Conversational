Title: Analysis of biomarkers in speculative CNS-enriched extracellular vesicles for parkinsonian disorders: a comprehensive systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis.
PMID: 38103086

Abstract:
Parkinsonian disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS), exhibit overlapping early-stage symptoms, complicating definitive diagnosis despite heterogeneous cellular and regional pathophysiology. Additionally, the progression and the eventual conversion of prodromal conditions such as REM behavior disorder (RBD) to PD, MSA, or DLB remain challenging to predict. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small, membrane-enclosed structures released by cells, playing a vital role in communicating cell-state-specific messages. Due to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier into the peripheral circulation, measuring biomarkers in blood-isolated speculative CNS enriched EVs has become a popular diagnostic approach. However, replication and independent validation remain challenging in this field. Here, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of speculative CNS-enriched EVs for parkinsonian disorders.
