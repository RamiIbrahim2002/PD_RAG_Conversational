PMID: 37433175

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PA) affects 1% of the global population above 60 years. PA pathogenesis involves severe neuroinflammation that impacts systemic and local inflammatory changes. We tested the hypothesis that PA is associated with periodontal tissue inflammation promoting a greater systemic inflammatory burden.
