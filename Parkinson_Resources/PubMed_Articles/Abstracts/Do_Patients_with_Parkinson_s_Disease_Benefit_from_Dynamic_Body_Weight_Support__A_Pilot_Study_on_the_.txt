Title: Do Patients with Parkinson's Disease Benefit from Dynamic Body Weight Support? A Pilot Study on the Emerging Role of Rysen.
PMID: 37626645

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor alterations. Typical motor symptoms include resting tremors, bradykinesia (hypokinesia or akinesia), muscular stiffness, gait alterations, and postural instability. In this context, neurorehabilitation may have a pivotal role in slowing the progression of PD, using both conventional and innovative rehabilitation approaches. Thirty patients (15 males and 15 females) affected by PD were enrolled in our study. We randomly divided the patients into two groups, an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). In particular, the EG performed gait and balance training using the Rysen system, which is an innovative body weight support (BWS) system, whilst the CG received conventional physiotherapy. Both groups underwent 20 sessions, five times weekly, with each session lasting about 40 min. At the end of the training sessions (T1), we found that both groups (EG and CG) achieved clinical improvements, although the EG showed better scores for post-treatment regarding global motor functioning and postural stability compared to the CG. In conclusion, our results suggest that the Rysen system, which is an innovative BWS tool, could be considered a valid device for improving postural control and global motor functions, when compared to conventional gait training, in patients affected by PD.
