Title: PARK7 Catalyzes Stereospecific Detoxification of Methylglyoxal Consistent with Glyoxalase and Not Deglycase Function.
PMID: 37884446

Abstract:
The protein PARK7 (also known as DJ-1) has been implicated in several diseases, with the most notable being Parkinson's disease. While several molecular and cellular roles have been ascribed to DJ-1, there is no real consensus on what its true cellular functions are and how the loss of DJ-1 function may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Recent reports have implicated DJ-1 in the detoxification of several reactive metabolites that are produced during glycolytic metabolism, with the most notable being the α-oxoaldehyde species methylglyoxal. While it is generally agreed that DJ-1 is able to metabolize methylglyoxal to lactate, the mechanism by which it does so is hotly debated with potential implications for cellular function. In this work, we provide definitive evidence that recombinant DJ-1 produced in human cells prevents the stable glycation of other proteins through the conversion of methylglyoxal or a related alkynyl dicarbonyl probe to their corresponding α-hydroxy carboxylic acid products. This protective action of DJ-1 does not require a physical interaction with a target protein, providing direct evidence for a glutathione-free glyoxalase and not a deglycase mechanism of methylglyoxal detoxification. Stereospecific liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measurements further uncovered the existence of nonenzymatic production of racemic lactate from MGO under physiological buffer conditions, whereas incubation with DJ-1 predominantly produces l-lactate. Collectively, these studies provide direct support for the stereospecific conversion of MGO to l-lactate by DJ-1 in solution with negligible or no contribution of direct protein deglycation.
