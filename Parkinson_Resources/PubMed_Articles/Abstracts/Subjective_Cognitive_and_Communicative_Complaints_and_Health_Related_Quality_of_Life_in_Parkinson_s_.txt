Title: Subjective Cognitive and Communicative Complaints and Health-Related Quality of Life in Parkinson's Disease with and without Mild Cognitive Impairment.
PMID: 38065663

Abstract:
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is common in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Few studies have compared the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in patients with and without MCI due to PD (PD-MCI), and its correlation to patients' subjective cognitive and communicative difficulties has not been explored.
