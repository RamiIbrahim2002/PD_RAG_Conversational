Title: Therapeutic Potential of Myrtenal and Its Derivatives-A Review.
PMID: 37895468

Abstract:
The investigation of monoterpenes as natural products has gained significant attention in the search for new pharmacological agents due to their ability to exhibit a wide range in biological activities, including antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant, anticancer, antispasmodic, hypotensive, and vasodilating properties. In vitro and in vivo studies reveal their antidepressant, anxiolytic, and memory-enhancing effects in experimental dementia and Parkinson's disease. Chemical modification of natural substances by conjugation with various synthetic components is a modern method of obtaining new biologically active compounds. The discovery of new potential drugs among monoterpene derivatives is a progressive avenue within experimental pharmacology, offering a promising approach for the therapy of diverse pathological conditions. Biologically active substances such as monoterpenes, for example, borneol, camphor, geraniol, pinene, and thymol, are used to synthesize compounds with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsive, antidepressant, anti-Alzheimer's, antiparkinsonian, antiviral and antibacterial (antituberculosis) properties. Myrtenal is a perspective monoterpenoid with therapeutic potential in various fields of medicine. Its chemical modifications often lead to new or more pronounced biological effects. As an example, the conjugation of myrtenal with the established pharmacophore adamantane enables the augmentation of several of its pivotal properties. Myrtenal-adamantane derivatives exhibited a variety of beneficial characteristics, such as antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, anticancer, anxiolytic, and neuroprotective properties, which are worth examining in more detail and at length.
