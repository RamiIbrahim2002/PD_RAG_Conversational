Title: Lifestyle strategies to promote proteostasis and reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other proteinopathies.
PMID: 38070831

Abstract:
Unhealthy lifestyle choices, poor diet, and aging can have negative influences on cognition, gradually increasing the risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the continuum comprising early dementia. Aging is the greatest risk factor for age-related dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, and the aging process is known to be influenced by life events that can positively or negatively affect age-related diseases. Remarkably, life experiences that make the brain vulnerable to dementia, such as seizure episodes, neurotoxin exposures, metabolic disorders, and trauma-inducing events (e.g. traumatic injuries or mild neurotrauma from a fall or blast exposure), have been associated with negative effects on proteostasis and synaptic integrity. Functional compromise of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, a major contributor to proteostasis, has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, obesity-related pathology, Huntington's disease, as well as in synaptic degeneration which is the best correlate of cognitive decline. Correspondingly, pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies that positively modulate lysosomal proteases are recognized as synaptoprotective through degradative clearance of pathogenic proteins. Here, we discuss life-associated vulnerabilities that influence key hallmarks of brain aging and the increased burden of age-related dementias. Additionally, we discuss exercise and diet among the lifestyle strategies that regulate proteostasis as well as synaptic integrity, leading to evident prevention of cognitive deficits during brain aging in pre-clinical models.
