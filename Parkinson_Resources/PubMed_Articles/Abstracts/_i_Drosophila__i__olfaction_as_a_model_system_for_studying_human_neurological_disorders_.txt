Title: <i>Drosophila</i> olfaction as a model system for studying human neurological disorders.
PMID: 37929819

Abstract:
The fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, has been one of the finest systems for decoding myriad puzzles across different domains of biology. Beyond addressing the fundamental problems, it has been used as a fantastic model organism for human disease research. Being an insect, <i>Drosophila</i> has a robust and advanced olfactory system that has been used many times as a model neuronal circuit to study fundamental questions in neurobiology. The circuit is well-explored at anatomical, physiological, and functional levels. It provides several advantages for the study of neurobiological disorders, such as spatiotemporally regulated misexpression or knockdown of disease proteins, genetic tractability, well-studied neuroanatomy, simple behavioural training paradigms, and quantifiable assays. Hence, <i>Drosophila</i> olfaction has been a favourite choice for the study of several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, fragile X syndrome, etc. This review aims to discuss earlier progress and future scope in using the <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory system for modelling human neurological pathophysiology for conducting fundamental and applied research. A major goal of research in biological science is to alleviate human disease burden. Diverse experimental systems are required to address different aspects of disease aetiology. <i>Drosophila</i> is one of the finest <i>in vivo</i> systems; its olfactory system is arguably the most well-characterized circuit for modelling human neurological disorders. A vast amount of research has been conducted to decipher cellular, molecular, and even cognitive aspects of human disorders using the <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory system. This review aims at summarizing such research progress to date and critically analysing the suitability of this system for modelling more complex neurological conditions.
