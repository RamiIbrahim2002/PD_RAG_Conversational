PMID: 37570794

Abstract:
<i>Apium graveolens</i> is an indigenous plant in the family Apiaceae, or Umbelliferae, that contains many active compounds. It has been used traditionally to treat arthritic conditions, gout, and urinary infections. The authors conducted a scoping review to assess the quality of available evidence on the overall effects of celery when treating neurological disorders. A systematic search was performed using predetermined keywords in selected electronic databases. The 26 articles included upon screening consisted of 19 in vivo studies, 1 published clinical trial, 4 in vitro studies and 2 studies comprising both in vivo and in vitro methods. <i>A. graveolens</i> and its bioactive phytoconstituent, 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP), have demonstrated their effect on neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke-related neurological complications, depression, diabetes-related neurological complications, and epilepsy. The safety findings were minimal, showing that NBP is safe for up to 18 weeks at 15 mg/kg in animal studies, while there were adverse effects (7%) reported when consuming NBP for 24 weeks at 600 mg daily in human trials. In conclusion, the safety of <i>A. graveolens</i> extract and NBP can be further investigated clinically on different neurological disorders based on their potential role in different targeted pathways.
