Title: Comparison of auditory cueing in toe tapping and gait in persons with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37727863

Abstract:
Much research has examined the relationship between bradykinesia and gait impairment in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). Specifically, impairments in repetitive movements of the upper extremity have been associated with freezing of gait. Studies examining lower extremity repetitive movements are limited. Moreover, the use of external cueing has been a treatment strategy for both bradykinesia and gait, but information on how cues should be used is lacking. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of auditory cueing on one side versus both sides for bilateral repetitive toe tapping and gait, and to determine if there was a relationship between toe tapping and gait. We hypothesize that there will be no difference between the cueing conditions, but that there will be a significant association between repetitive toe tapping performance and gait performance.
