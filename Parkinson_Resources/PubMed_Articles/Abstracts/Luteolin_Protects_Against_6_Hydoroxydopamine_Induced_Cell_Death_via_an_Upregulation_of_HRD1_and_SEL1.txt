Title: Luteolin Protects Against 6-Hydoroxydopamine-Induced Cell Death via an Upregulation of HRD1 and SEL1L.
PMID: 37632637

Abstract:
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is caused by many factors and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is considered as one of the responsible factors for it. ER stress induces the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to degrade unfolded proteins and suppress cell death. The ubiquitin ligase 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase degradation 1 (HRD1) and its stabilizing molecule, the suppressor/enhancer lin-12-like (SEL1L), can suppress the ER stress via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and that HRD1 can also suppress cell death in familial and nonfamilial PD models. These findings indicate that HRD1 and SEL1L might be key proteins for the treatment of PD. Our study aimed to identify the compounds with the effects of upregulating the HRD1 expression and suppressing neuronal cell death in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cellular PD model. Our screening by the Drug Gene Budger, a drug repositioning tool, identified luteolin as a candidate compound for the desired modulation of the HRD1 expression. Subsequently, we confirmed that low concentrations of luteolin did not show cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, and used these low concentrations in the subsequent experiments. Next, we demonsrated that luteolin increased HRD1 and SEL1L mRNA levels and protein expressions. Furthermore, luteolin inhibited 6-OHDA-induced cell death and suppressed ER stress response caused by exposure to 6-OHDA. Finally, luteolin did not reppress 6-OHDA-induced cell death when expression of HRD1 or SEL1L was suppressed by RNA interference. These findings suggest that luteolin might be a novel therapeutic agent for PD due to its ability to suppress ER stress through the activation of HRD1 and SEL1L.
