Title: Acute effect of levodopa on orthostatic hypotension and its association with motor responsiveness in Parkinson's disease: Results of acute levodopa challenge test.
PMID: 37742502

Abstract:
Levodopa administration can induce or worsen orthostatic hypotension (OH) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Understanding of acute OH post levodopa (AOHPL) is important for rational drug use in PD patients. Primary objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of AOHPL in PD patients. The secondary objectives were a) hemodynamic character of AOHPL; b) risk factors of AOHPL; c) relationship between motor responsiveness and blood pressure (BP) change.
