Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) research on specific neuroimaging and neurophysiological biomarkers revealing executive dysfunction mechanisms is limited, necessitating validation. Thus, our study aimed to assess associations between electroencephalographic power spectral density (PSD-EEG), striatal [<sup>18</sup> F]Fluorodopa uptake and neuropsychological executive function (EF) testing parameters in PD, while also estimating their diagnostic accuracy. We compared resting PSD-EEG, striatal [<sup>18</sup> F]Fluorodopa uptake ratios based on positron emission computed tomography ([<sup>18</sup> F]FDOPA PET/CT) and neuropsychological EF tests outcomes [Trail Making Test (TMT) and Stroop Test (ST)] between PD patients and healthy controls (HCO) and then calculated correlations among these measures separately for each group. Additionally, we estimated PD diagnostic accuracy of the PSD-EEG and [<sup>18</sup> F]FDOPA PET/CT parameters. In PD patients, we observed the following: (i) slower EEG waves, reflected in increased power of the EEG theta and lower-alpha bands in frontal lobe areas; (ii) reduced [<sup>18</sup> F]FDOPA PET/CT uptake in the putaminal and caudate nuclei, along with a decreased putamen-to-caudate ratio ([<sup>18</sup> F]FDOPA PET/CT PCR); and (iii) longer performance times evident in nearly all EF tests' parameters. Slower EEG waves correlated negatively with [<sup>18</sup> F]FDOPA PET/CT PCR and positively with most of the EF test parameters. Furthermore, we found negative correlations between [<sup>18</sup> F]FDOPA PET/CT PCR and certain EF measures related to ST. [<sup>18</sup> F]FDOPA PET/CT ratios and several PSD-EEG parameters, particularly those from the prefrontal cortex, demonstrated clinically reasonable diagnostic accuracy for PD. In conclusion, EEG waves slowing in the frontal lobe were correlated with striatal dopaminergic deficiency and impaired executive function in mild PD patients and showed promise as a biomarker of PD-related executive dysfunction.
