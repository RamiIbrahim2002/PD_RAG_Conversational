Title: Low-dose inhalation exposure to trichloroethylene induces dopaminergic neurodegeneration in rodents.
PMID: 37669148

Abstract:
Trichloroethylene (TCE) is one of the most pervasive environmental contaminants in the world and is associated with Parkinson disease (PD) risk. Experimental models in rodents show that TCE is selectively toxic to dopaminergic neurons at high doses of ingestion, however, TCE is a highly volatile toxicant, and the primary pathway of human exposure is inhalation. As TCE is a highly lipophilic, volatile organic compound (VOC), inhalation exposure results in rapid diffusion throughout the brain, avoiding first-pass hepatic metabolism that necessitated high doses to recapitulate exposure conditions observed in human populations. We hypothesized that inhalation of TCE would induce significantly more potent neurodegeneration than ingestion and better recapitulate environmental conditions of vapor intrusion or off gassing from liquid TCE. To this end, we developed a novel, whole-body passive exposure inhalation chamber in which we exposed 10-month-old male and female Lewis rats to 50 ppm TCE (time weighted average, TWA) or filtered room air (control) over 8 weeks. In addition, we exposed 12-month-old male and female C57Bl/6 mice to 100 ppm TCE (TWA) or control over 12 weeks. Both rats and mice exposed to chronic TCE inhalation showed significant degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons as well as motor and gait impairments. TCE exposure also induced accumulation of pSer129-αSyn in dopaminergic neurons as well as microglial activation within the substantia nigra of rats. Collectively, these data indicate that TCE inhalation causes highly potent dopaminergic neurodegeneration and recapitulates some of the observed neuropathology associated with PD, providing a future platform for insight into the mechanisms and environmental conditions that influence PD risk from TCE exposure.
