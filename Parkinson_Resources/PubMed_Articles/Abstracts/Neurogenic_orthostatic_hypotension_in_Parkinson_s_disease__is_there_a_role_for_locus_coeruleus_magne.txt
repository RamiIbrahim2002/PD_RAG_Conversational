Title: Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in Parkinson's disease: is there a role for locus coeruleus magnetic resonance imaging?
PMID: 38032367

Abstract:
Locus coeruleus (LC) is the main noradrenergic nucleus of the brain, and degenerates early in Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study is to test whether degeneration of the LC is associated with orthostatic hypotension (OH) in PD. A total of 22 cognitively intact PD patients and 52 age-matched healthy volunteers underwent 3 T magnetic resonance (MRI) with neuromelanin-sensitive T1-weighted sequences (LC-MRI). For each subject, a template space-based LC-MRI was used to calculate LC signal intensity (LC contrast ratio-LC<sub>CR</sub>) and the estimated number of voxels (LC<sub>VOX</sub>) belonging to LC. Then, we compared the LC-MRI parameters in PD patients with OH (PD<sup>OH+</sup>) versus without OH (PD<sup>OH-</sup>) (matched for sex, age, and disease duration) using one-way analysis of variance followed by multiple comparison tests. We also tested for correlations between subject's LC-MRI features and orthostatic drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP). PD<sup>OH-</sup> and PD<sup>OH+</sup> did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) based on demographics and clinical characteristics, except for blood pressure measurements and SCOPA-AUT cardiovascular domain (p < 0.05). LC<sub>CR</sub> and LC<sub>VOX</sub> measures were significantly lower in PD compared to HC, while no differences were observed between PD<sup>OH-</sup> and PD<sup>OH+</sup>. Additionally, no correlation was found between the LC-MRI parameters and the orthostatic drop in SBP or the clinical severity of autonomic symptoms (p > 0.05). Conversely, RBD symptom severity negatively correlated with several LC-MRI parameters. Our results failed to indicate a link between the LC-MRI features and the presence of OH in PD but confirmed a marked alteration of LC signal in PD patients.
