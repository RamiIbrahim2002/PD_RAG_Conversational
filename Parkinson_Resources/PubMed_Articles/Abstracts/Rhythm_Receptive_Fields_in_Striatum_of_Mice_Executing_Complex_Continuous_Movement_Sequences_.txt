Title: Rhythm Receptive Fields in Striatum of Mice Executing Complex Continuous Movement Sequences.
PMID: 37790358

Abstract:
By the use of a novel experimental system, the step-wheel, we investigated the neural underpinnings of complex and continuous movements. We recorded neural activities from the dorsolateral striatum and found neurons sensitive to movement rhythm parameters. These neurons responded to specific combinations of interval, phase, and repetition of movement, effectively forming what we term "rhythm receptive fields." Some neurons even responsive to the combination of movement phases of multiple body parts. In parallel, cortical recordings in sensorimotor areas highlighted a paucity of neurons responsive to multiple parameter combinations, relative to those in the striatum. These findings have implications for comprehending motor coordination deficits seen in brain disorders including Parkinson's disease. Movement encoding by rhythm receptive fields should streamline the brain's capacity to encode temporal patterns, help to resolve the degrees of freedom problem. Such rhythm fields hint at the neural mechanisms governing effective motor control and processing of rhythmic information.
