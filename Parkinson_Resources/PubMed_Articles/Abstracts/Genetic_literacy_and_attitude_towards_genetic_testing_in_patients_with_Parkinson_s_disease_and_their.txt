PMID: 37743165

Abstract:
Genetic literacy refers to an individual's ability to understand the basics of genetic concepts and apply them to health-related decisions. The level of genetic literacy influences attitude towards genetic testing and is, in turn, influenced by several other factors. Clinicians must be aware of the genetic literacy of their patients and their caregivers before advising genetic testing and/or undertaking pre and post-test counseling.
