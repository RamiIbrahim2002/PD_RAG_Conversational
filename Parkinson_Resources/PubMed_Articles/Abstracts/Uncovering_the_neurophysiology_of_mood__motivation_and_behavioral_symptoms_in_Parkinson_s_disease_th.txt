Title: Uncovering the neurophysiology of mood, motivation and behavioral symptoms in Parkinson's disease through intracranial recordings.
PMID: 37735477

Abstract:
Neuropsychiatric mood and motivation symptoms (depression, anxiety, apathy, impulse control disorders) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are highly disabling, difficult to treat and exacerbated by current medications and deep brain stimulation therapies. High-resolution intracranial recording techniques have the potential to undercover the network dysfunction and cognitive processes that drive these symptoms, towards a principled re-tuning of circuits. We highlight intracranial recording as a valuable tool for mapping and desegregating neural networks and their contribution to mood, motivation and behavioral symptoms, via the ability to dissect multiplexed overlapping spatial and temporal neural components. This technique can be powerfully combined with behavioral paradigms and emerging computational techniques to model underlying latent behavioral states. We review the literature of intracranial recording studies investigating mood, motivation and behavioral symptomatology with reference to 1) emotional processing, 2) executive control 3) subjective valuation (reward & cost evaluation) 4) motor control and 5) learning and updating. This reveals associations between different frequency specific network activities and underlying cognitive processes of reward decision making and action control. If validated, these signals represent potential computational biomarkers of motivational and behavioural states and could lead to principled therapy development for mood, motivation and behavioral symptoms in PD.
