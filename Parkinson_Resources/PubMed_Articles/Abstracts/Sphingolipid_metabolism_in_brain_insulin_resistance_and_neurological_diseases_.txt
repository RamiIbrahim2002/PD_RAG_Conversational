Title: Sphingolipid metabolism in brain insulin resistance and neurological diseases.
PMID: 37867511

Abstract:
Sphingolipids, as members of the large lipid family, are important components of plasma membrane. Sphingolipids participate in biological signal transduction to regulate various important physiological processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, senescence, and differentiation. Numerous studies have demonstrated that sphingolipids are strongly associated with glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance, including peripheral insulin resistance and brain insulin resistance, is closely related to the occurrence and development of many metabolic diseases. In addition to metabolic diseases, like type 2 diabetes, brain insulin resistance is also involved in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the specific mechanism of sphingolipids in brain insulin resistance has not been systematically summarized. This article reviews the involvement of sphingolipids in brain insulin resistance, highlighting the role and molecular biological mechanism of sphingolipid metabolism in cognitive dysfunctions and neuropathological abnormalities of the brain.
