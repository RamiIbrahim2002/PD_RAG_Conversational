Title: Understanding factors that impact the length of stay after total hip arthroplasty - A national in-patient sample-based study.
PMID: 38046927

Abstract:
Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is increasingly used every year; however, there is currently limited information on factors that impact the length of stay (LOS) following the procedure. Longer LOS following THA is met with an increase in the cost of care, necessitating studies to identify factors that may impact LOS.
