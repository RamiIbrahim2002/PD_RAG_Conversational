Title: Weight and survival after deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37660542

Abstract:
Weight loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) is common and associated with increased mortality. The clinical significance of weight changes following deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) is unclear.
