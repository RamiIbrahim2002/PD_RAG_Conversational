PMID: 37863747

Abstract:
To verify the diagnostic performance of the loss of nigrosome-1 on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) with compressed sensing-sensitivity encoding (CS-SENSE) and neuromelanin on neuromelanin-sensitive (NM) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical Parkinsonism.
