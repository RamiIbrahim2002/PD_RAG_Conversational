Abstract:
The accumulation of excessively high manganese levels within the brain can contribute to a series of Parkinsonian symptoms referred to as manganism. The gasoline antiknock additive Methylcyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl (MMT) is an environmental source of manganese exposure and can induce manganism in rats. While some prior reports have demonstrated the differential expression of small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), the degree of sncRNA dysfunction in manganism has yet to be clearly documented. As sncRNAs such as transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and ribosomal RNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs) exhibit high levels of modifications such as 3' terminal 3'-phosphate and 2',3'-cyclic phosphate modifications that disrupt the process of adapter ligation and m<sup>1</sup>A, m<sup>3</sup>C, m<sup>1</sup>G, and m<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>G RNA methylation, these transcripts are not detected in traditional small RNA-sequencing studies. Here, differential sncRNA expression was analyzed by comparing a rat model of MMT-induced unrepaired striatum damage to appropriate control samples via PANDORA-Seq, which can detect highly modified sncRNAs. Following the removal of sncRNA modifications, this approach identified 599 sncRNAs that were differentially expressed in the striatum of MMT-exposed rats relative to controls, as well as 1155 sncRNAs that were differentially expressed in Mn-treated and control rats. Additional functional analyses were performed to predict the putative targets of these sncRNAs, implicating a role for such sncRNA dysregulation in the pathogenesis of manganism in this rat model system.
