Title: Subtle changes in central dopaminergic tone underlie bradykinesia in essential tremor.
PMID: 37847966

Abstract:
In this research, our primary objective was to explore the correlation between basal ganglia dopaminergic neurotransmission, assessed using 123I-FP-CIT (DAT-SPECT), and finger movements abnormalities in patients with essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD).
