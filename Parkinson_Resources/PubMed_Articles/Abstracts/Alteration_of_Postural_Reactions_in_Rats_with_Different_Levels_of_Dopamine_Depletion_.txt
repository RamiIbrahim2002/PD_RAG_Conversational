Title: Alteration of Postural Reactions in Rats with Different Levels of Dopamine Depletion.
PMID: 37509596

Abstract:
Dopamine (DA) is the critical neurotransmitter involved in the unconscious control of muscle tone and body posture. We evaluated the general motor capacities and muscle responses to postural disturbance in three conditions: normal DA level (wild-type rats, WT), mild DA deficiency (WT after administration of Î±-methyl-p-tyrosine-AMPT, that blocks DA synthesis), and severe DA depletion (DAT-KO rats after AMPT). The horizontal displacements in WT rats elicited a multi-component EMG corrective response in the flexor and extensor muscles. Similar to the gradual progression of DA-related diseases, we observed different degrees of bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability after AMPT. The mild DA deficiency impaired the initiation pattern of corrective responses, specifically delaying the extensor muscles' activity ipsilaterally to displacement direction and earlier extensor activity from the opposite side. DA depletion in DAT-KO rats after AMPT elicited tremors, general stiffness, and akinesia, and caused earlier response to horizontal displacements in the coactivated flexor and extensor muscles bilaterally. The data obtained show the specific role of DA in postural reactions and suggest that this experimental approach can be used to investigate sensorimotor control in different dopamine-deficient states and to model DA-related diseases.
