Title: Advances in microfluidic chips targeting toxic aggregation proteins for neurodegenerative diseases.
PMID: 37992921

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are characterized by nervous system damage, often influenced by genetic and aging factors. Pathological analysis frequently reveals the presence of aggregated toxic proteins. The intricate and poorly understood origins of these diseases have hindered progress in early diagnosis and drug development. The development of novel in-vitro and in-vivo models could enhance our comprehension of ND mechanisms and facilitate clinical treatment advancements. Microfluidic chips are employed to establish three-dimensional culture conditions, replicating the human ecological niche and creating a microenvironment conducive to neuronal cell survival. The incorporation of mechatronic controls unifies the chip, cells, and culture medium optimizing living conditions for the cells. This study provides a comprehensive overview of microfluidic chip applications in drug and biomarker screening for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our Lab-on-a-Chip system releases toxic proteins to simulate the pathological characteristics of neurodegenerative diseases, encompassing β-amyloid, α-synuclein, huntingtin, TAR DNA-binding protein 43, and Myelin Basic Protein. Investigating molecular and cellular interactions in vitro can enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms while minimizing harmful protein levels and can aid in screening potential therapeutic agents. We anticipate that our research will promote the utilization of microfluidic chips in both fundamental research and clinical applications for neurodegenerative diseases.
