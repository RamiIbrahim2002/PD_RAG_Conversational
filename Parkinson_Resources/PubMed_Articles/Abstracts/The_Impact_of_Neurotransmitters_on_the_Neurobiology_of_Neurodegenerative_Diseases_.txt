Title: The Impact of Neurotransmitters on the Neurobiology of Neurodegenerative Diseases.
PMID: 37895020

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Neurodegenerative diseases result from progressive damage to nerve cells in the brain or peripheral nervous system connections that are essential for cognition, coordination, strength, sensation, and mobility. Dysfunction of these brain and nerve functions is associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and motor neuron disease. In addition to these, 50% of people living with HIV develop a spectrum of cognitive, motor, and/or mood problems collectively referred to as HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) despite the widespread use of a combination of antiretroviral therapies. Neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter systems have a pathological correlation and play a critical role in developing neurodegenerative diseases. Each of these diseases has a unique pattern of dysregulation of the neurotransmitter system, which has been attributed to different forms of cell-specific neuronal loss. In this review, we will focus on a discussion of the regulation of dopaminergic and cholinergic systems, which are more commonly disturbed in neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, we will provide evidence for the hypothesis that disturbances in neurotransmission contribute to the neuronal loss observed in neurodegenerative disorders. Further, we will highlight the critical role of dopamine as a mediator of neuronal injury and loss in the context of NeuroHIV. This review will highlight the need to further investigate neurotransmission systems for their role in the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders.
