Title: Comparison of Anatomical and Diffusion MRI for detecting Parkinson's Disease using Deep Convolutional Neural Network.
PMID: 38083460

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects over 10 million people worldwide. Brain atrophy and microstructural abnormalities tend to be more subtle in PD than in other age-related conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, so there is interest in how well machine learning methods can detect PD in radiological scans. Deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can automatically distil diagnostically useful features from raw MRI scans, but most CNN-based deep learning models have only been tested on T1-weighted brain MRI. Here we examine the added value of diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) - a variant of MRI, sensitive to microstructural tissue properties - as an additional input in CNN-based models for PD classification. Our evaluations used data from 3 separate cohorts - from Chang Gung University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the PPMI dataset. We trained CNNs on various combinations of these cohorts to find the best predictive model. Although tests on more diverse data are warranted, deep-learned models from dMRI show promise for PD classification.Clinical Relevance- This study supports the use of diffusion-weighted images as an alternative to anatomical images for AI-based detection of Parkinson's disease.
