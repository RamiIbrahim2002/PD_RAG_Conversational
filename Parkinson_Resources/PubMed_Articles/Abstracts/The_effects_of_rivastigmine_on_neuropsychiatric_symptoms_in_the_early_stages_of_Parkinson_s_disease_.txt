Title: The effects of rivastigmine on neuropsychiatric symptoms in the early stages of Parkinson's disease: A systematic review.
PMID: 37975761

Abstract:
Neuropsychiatric symptoms including depression, apathy and psychosis occur frequently in patients with Parkinson's disease. A subgroup of patients develop cognitive impairment, which may increase the risk of falls due to reduced attention. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine is beneficial in Parkinson's disease dementia, but whether the use of rivastigmine is effective earlier in the disease course is unclear. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence for rivastigmine in the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease without dementia.
