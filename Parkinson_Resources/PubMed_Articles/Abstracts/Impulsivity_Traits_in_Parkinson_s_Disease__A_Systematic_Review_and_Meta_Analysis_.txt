Title: Impulsivity Traits in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PMID: 37868926

Abstract:
In Parkinson's disease (PD), impulsivity as a personality trait may be linked to the risk of developing impulse control disorders (ICDs) during dopaminergic therapy. However, studies evaluating differences in trait impulsivity between patients with PD and healthy controls or between patients with PD with and without ICDs reported partly inconsistent findings.
