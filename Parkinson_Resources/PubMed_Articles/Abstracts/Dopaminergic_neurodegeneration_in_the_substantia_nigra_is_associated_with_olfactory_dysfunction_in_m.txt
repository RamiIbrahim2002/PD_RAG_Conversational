Abstract:
Olfactory dysfunction represents a prodromal stage in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanisms underlying hyposmia are not specified yet. In this study, we first observed an early olfactory dysfunction in mice with intragastric rotenone administration, consistent with dopaminergic neurons loss and α-synuclein pathology in the olfactory bulb. However, a much severer olfactory dysfunction was observed without severer pathology in olfactory bulb when the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra occurred. Then, we established the mice models by intrastriatal α-synuclein preformed fibrils injection and demonstrated the performance in the olfactory discrimination test was correlated to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, without any changes in the olfactory bulb analyzed by RNA-sequence. In mice with intranasal ferric ammonium citrate administration, we observed olfactory dysfunction when dopaminergic neurodegeneration in substantia nigra occurred and was restored when dopaminergic neurons were rescued. Finally we demonstrated that chemogenetic inhibition of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra was sufficient to cause hyposmia and motor incoordination. Taken together, this study shows a direct relationship between nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration and olfactory dysfunction in PD models and put forward the understandings that olfactory dysfunction represents the early stage of neurodegeneration in PD progression.
