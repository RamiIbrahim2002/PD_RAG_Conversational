Title: Stellate ganglion block to mitigate thalamic pain syndrome of an oncological origin.
PMID: 37485837

Abstract:
Thalamic pain syndrome (TPS) is an enigmatic and rare condition. Thalamic pain syndrome is under the umbrella of central pain syndrome, which is classically associated with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, postamputation, epilepsy, stroke, tumor, and Parkinson's disease. The mainstay treatment of TPS is polypharmacy. There is uncertainty about the intermediate options to manage medication-resistant TPS before resorting to invasive, and often expensive, intracranial therapies. Stellate ganglion block (SGB) has shown promise in reducing TPS symptoms of the upper extremity and face following a thalamic ischemic event.
