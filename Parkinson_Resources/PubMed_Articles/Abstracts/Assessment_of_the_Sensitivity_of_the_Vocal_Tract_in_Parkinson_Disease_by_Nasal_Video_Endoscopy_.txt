Title: Assessment of the Sensitivity of the Vocal Tract in Parkinson Disease by Nasal Video Endoscopy.
PMID: 37876684

Abstract:
<b>Introduction</b>  Sensory deficits of the upper airways are common in people with Parkinson disease. Compounded by considerable deterioration of the swallowing function, these deficits may contribute to the elevated rates of morbidity and mortality among this population. <b>Objective</b>  To examine the sensitivity of the vocal tracts of people with Parkinson disease using nasal videoendoscopy and to compare the results with paired controls. <b>Methods</b>  The present was a prospective, observational, case-control study. Sensitivity assessments were conducted in a sample of 24 people divided into 2 groups: one group of 12 patients with Parkinson's disease, and a control group with 12 healthy subjects. The study group also underwent a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing and answered the Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire (SQD) to detect dysphagia. <b>Results</b>  There was a significant difference ( <i>p</i>  < 0.05) in the region of the arytenoid cartilages, showing that sensitivity was better preserved among the control group, and that sensitivity deficits were present in the study group. The qualitative results showed sensorial impairment in the study group than in the control group regarding the base of the tongue, the vestibular folds, and the vocal folds. The study group showed self-awareness regarding the deficits in the swallowing function, but there was no statistically significant association between swallowing function deficits and deterioration of sensorial function among them. <b>Conclusions</b>  Sensorial deficits were present in the study group when compared to the healthy subjects, mainly in the qualitative evaluation.
