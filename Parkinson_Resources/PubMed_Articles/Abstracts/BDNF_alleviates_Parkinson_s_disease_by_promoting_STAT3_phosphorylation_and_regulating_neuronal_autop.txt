PMID: 37450039

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the gradual death of dopaminergic neurons. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptors are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system, which can promote the survival and growth of neurons and protect neurons. This study revealed that BDNF promotes STAT3 phosphorylation and regulates autophagy in neurons. The PD mouse model was established by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Moreover, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>) to establish a PD cell model. The level of BDNF was low in PD model mice and SH-SY5Y cells treated with MPP<sup>+</sup>. BDNF enhanced the levels of p-TrkB, P-STAT3, PINK1, and DJ-1. BDNF promoted autophagy, inhibited the level of p-Î±-syn (Ser129) and enhanced cell proliferation. The autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-methyladenine, 3-MA) reversed the protective effects of BDNF on neurons. BiFC assay results showed that there was a direct physical interaction between BDNF and STAT3, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated an interaction between STAT3 and PI3K. The PI3K agonist Recilisib activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, promoted autophagy, and alleviated neuronal cell damage. BDNF alleviates PD pathology by promoting STAT3 phosphorylation and regulating neuronal autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells and cultured primary neurons. Finally, BDNF has neuroprotective effects on PD model mice.
