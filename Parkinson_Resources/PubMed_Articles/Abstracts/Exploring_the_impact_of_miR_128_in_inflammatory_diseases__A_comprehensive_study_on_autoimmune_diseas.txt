Title: Exploring the impact of miR-128 in inflammatory diseases: A comprehensive study on autoimmune diseases.
PMID: 37499519

Abstract:
microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in various biological processes, including immune system regulation, such as cell proliferation, tolerance (central and peripheral), and T helper cell development. Dysregulation of miRNA expression and activity can disrupt immune responses and increase susceptibility to neuroimmune disorders. Conversely, miRNAs have been shown to have a protective role in modulating immune responses and preventing autoimmunity. Specifically, reducing the expression of miRNA-128 (miR-128) in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model has been found to improve cognitive deficits and reduce neuropathology. This comprehensive review focuses on the significance of miR-128 in the pathogenesis of neuroautoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS), AD, Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), epilepsy, as well as other immune-mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Additionally, we present compelling evidence supporting the potential use of miR-128 as a diagnostic or therapeutic biomarker for neuroimmune disorders. Collectively, the available literature suggests that targeting miR-128 could be a promising strategy to alleviate the behavioral symptoms associated with neuroimmune diseases. Furthermore, further research in this area may uncover new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders and potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.
