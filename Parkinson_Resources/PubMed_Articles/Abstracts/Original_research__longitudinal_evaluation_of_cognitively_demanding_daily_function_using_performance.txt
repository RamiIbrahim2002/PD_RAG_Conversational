PMID: 37434765

Abstract:
Longitudinal assessment of functional abilities in Parkinson's disease (PD) is needed to determine the efficacy of cognitive interventions in providing meaningful improvements in daily life. Additionally, subtle changes in instrumental activities of daily living may precede a clinical diagnosis of dementia and could aid earlier detection of and intervention for cognitive decline.
