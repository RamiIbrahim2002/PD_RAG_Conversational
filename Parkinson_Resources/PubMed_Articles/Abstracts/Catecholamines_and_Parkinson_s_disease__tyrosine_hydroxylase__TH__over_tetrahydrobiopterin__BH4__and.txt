Abstract:
The author identified the genes and proteins of human enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4): tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), dopamine Î²-hydroxylase (DBH), phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), and GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1). In Parkinson's disease (PD), the activities and levels of mRNA and protein of all catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes are decreased, especially in dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Hereditary GCH1 deficiency results in reductions in the levels of BH4 and the activities of TH, causing decreases in dopamine levels. Severe deficiencies in GCH1 or TH cause severe decreases in dopamine levels leading to severe neurological symptoms, whereas mild decreases in TH activity in mild GCH1 deficiency or in mild TH deficiency result in only modest reductions in dopamine levels and symptoms of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD, Segawa disease) or juvenile Parkinsonism. DRD is a treatable disease and small doses of L-DOPA can halt progression. The death of dopamine neurons in PD in the substantia nigra may be related to (i) inflammatory effect of extra neuronal neuromelanin, (ii) inflammatory cytokines which are produced by activated microglia, (iii) decreased levels of BDNF, and/or (iv) increased levels of apoptosis-related factors. This review also discusses progress in gene therapies for the treatment of PD, and of GCH1, TH and AADC deficiencies, by transfection of TH, AADC, and GCH1 via adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors.
