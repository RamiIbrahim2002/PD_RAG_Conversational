PMID: 37938142

Abstract:
Dopamine (DA) at normal levels in the human body exhibits a high potential for maintaining a proper neuron network. However, their abnormalities in humans can bring out aggressive disorders such as Schizophrenia, hypertension, Tourette's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar depression, Parkinson's disease, drug addiction and attention-deficit hyperactivity diseases. Hence, in this study, a bis-quinoline-substituted calix[4] arene carboxylic acid derivative (<b>Quin-Calix-CO<sub>2</sub>H</b>) at cone conformation was developed as an effective fluorescent sensor for the detection of a catecholamine neurotransmitter (dopamine). The structure of <b>Quin-Calix-CO<sub>2</sub>H</b> was confirmed using <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, ESI-MS and elemental analysis techniques. The calixarene-based fluorescent sensor (<b>Quin-Calix-CO<sub>2</sub>H</b>) has shown fluorescence emission at 404 nm under the excitation of 270 nm. Further, biomolecules binding property of <b>Quin-Calix-CO<sub>2</sub>H</b> against various biomolecules such as L-cysteine (L-Cys), α-D-glucose (D-Glu), (+)-sodium-L-ascorbate (SAA), urea (UR), L-alanine (L-Ala) and dopamine (DA) exhibited that the fluorescent sensor enables selectively and sensitively detection for DA with a remarkable affinity. The probe <b>Quin-Calix-CO<sub>2</sub>H</b> has shown fluorescence quenching towards DA concentration ranging from 0 to 4.0 µM with a very low limit of detection (LOD) of 88.5 nmol L<sup>-1</sup>. In addition, the binding constant and stoichiometry as well as the mechanism of quenching have been also determined from the fluorescence data.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
