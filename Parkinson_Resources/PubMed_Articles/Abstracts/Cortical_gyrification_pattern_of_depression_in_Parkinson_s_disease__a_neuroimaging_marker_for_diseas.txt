Title: Cortical gyrification pattern of depression in Parkinson's disease: a neuroimaging marker for disease severity?
PMID: 38035271

Abstract:
Although the study of the neuroanatomical correlates of depression in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is gaining increasing interest, up to now the cortical gyrification pattern of PD-related depression has not been reported. This study was conducted to investigate the local gyrification index (LGI) in PD patients with depression, and its associations with the severity of depression.
