PMID: 37800233

Abstract:
In the present study, I provide an examination of the neuropsychiatric approach to patients with various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and more. With a focus on the intersection of psychiatry and neurology, this paper underscores the importance of comprehensive neuropsychiatric evaluation, rigorous diagnosis, and evidence-based management. The paper delineates the neuropsychiatric manifestations specific to each type of dementia and explores both non-pharmacological and pharmacological management strategies, aiming to equip psychiatrists with the latest evidence-based approaches. Case studies are included to demonstrate real-world clinical scenarios and to provide insights into the practical application of the theories discussed. Additionally, this guide addresses current challenges in the neuropsychiatric approach to dementia and highlights potential solutions and future research directions. The primary objective of this guide is to enable psychiatrists to enhance the quality of life for individuals living with dementia by improving understanding, diagnosis, and management of the neuropsychiatric aspects of these conditions.
