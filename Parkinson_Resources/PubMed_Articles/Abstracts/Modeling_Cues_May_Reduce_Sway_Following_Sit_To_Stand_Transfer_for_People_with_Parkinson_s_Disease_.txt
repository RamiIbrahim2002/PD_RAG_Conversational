Title: Modeling Cues May Reduce Sway Following Sit-To-Stand Transfer for People with Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37430617

Abstract:
Cues are commonly used to overcome the effects of motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. Little is known about the impact of cues on postural sway during transfers. The objective of this study was to identify if three different types of explicit cues provided during transfers of people with Parkinson's disease results in postural sway more similar to healthy controls. This crossover study had 13 subjects in both the Parkinson's and healthy control groups. All subjects completed three trials of uncued sit to stand transfers. The Parkinson's group additionally completed three trials of sit to stand transfers in three conditions: external attentional focus of reaching to targets, external attentional focus of concurrent modeling, and explicit cue for internal attentional focus. Body worn sensors collected sway data, which was compared between groups with Mann Whitney U tests and between conditions with Friedman's Tests. Sway normalized with modeling but was unchanged in the other conditions. Losses of balance presented with reaching towards targets and cueing for an internal attentional focus. Modeling during sit to stand of people with Parkinson's disease may safely reduce sway more than other common cues.
