Title: Contribution of amyloid and putative Lewy body pathologies in neuropsychiatric symptoms.
PMID: 37655505

Abstract:
Neuropsychiatric symptom could be useful for detecting patients with prodromal dementia. Similarities and differences in the NPSs between preclinical/prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prodromal Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD)/Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) may exist. This study aimed to compare the NPSs between preclinical/prodromal AD and prodromal PDD/DLB.
