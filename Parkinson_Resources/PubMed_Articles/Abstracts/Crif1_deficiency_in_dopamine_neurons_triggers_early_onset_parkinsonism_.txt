Title: Crif1 deficiency in dopamine neurons triggers early-onset parkinsonism.
PMID: 37648779

Abstract:
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in Parkinson's Disease (PD) progression; however, the mitochondrial factors underlying the development of PD symptoms remain unclear. One candidate is CR6-interacting factor1 (CRIF1), which controls translation and membrane insertion of 13 mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Here, we found that CRIF1 mRNA and protein expression were significantly reduced in postmortem brains of elderly PD patients compared to normal controls. To evaluate the effect of Crif1 deficiency, we produced mice lacking the Crif1 gene in dopaminergic neurons (DAT-CRIF1-KO mice). From 5 weeks of age, DAT-CRIF1-KO mice began to show decreased dopamine production with progressive neuronal degeneration in the nigral area. At ~10 weeks of age, they developed PD-like behavioral deficits, including gait abnormalities, rigidity, and resting tremor. L-DOPA, a medication used to treat PD, ameliorated these defects at an early stage, although it was ineffective in older mice. Taken together, the observation that CRIF1 expression is reduced in human PD brains and deletion of CRIF1 in dopaminergic neurons leads to early-onset PD with stepwise PD progression support the conclusion that CRIF1-mediated mitochondrial function is important for the survival of dopaminergic neurons.
