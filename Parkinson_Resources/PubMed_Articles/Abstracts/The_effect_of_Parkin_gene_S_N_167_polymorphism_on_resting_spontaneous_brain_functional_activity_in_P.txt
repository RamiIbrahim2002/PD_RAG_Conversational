Title: The effect of Parkin gene S/N 167 polymorphism on resting spontaneous brain functional activity in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37454429

Abstract:
Genetic susceptibility plays a significant role in Parkinson's disease (PD) development. Carriers of the Parkin S/N167 mutation may have an increased risk of PD and altered spontaneous brain activity.
