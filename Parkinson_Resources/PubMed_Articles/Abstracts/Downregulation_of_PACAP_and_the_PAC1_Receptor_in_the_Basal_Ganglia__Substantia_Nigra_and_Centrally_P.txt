Abstract:
Numerous in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson's disease (PD) demonstrate that pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) conveys its strong neuroprotective actions mainly via its specific PAC1 receptor (PAC1R) in models of PD. We recently described the decrease in PAC1R protein content in the basal ganglia of macaques in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD that was partially reversed by levodopa therapy. In this work, we tested whether these observations occur also in the rotenone model of PD in the rat. The rotarod test revealed motor skill deterioration upon rotenone administration, which was reversed by benserazide/levodopa (B/L) treatment. The sucrose preference test suggested increased depression level while the open field test showed increased anxiety in rats rendered parkinsonian, regardless of the received B/L therapy. Reduced dopaminergic cell count in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) diminished the dopaminergic fiber density in the caudate-putamen (CPu) and decreased the peptidergic cell count in the centrally projecting Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EWcp), supporting the efficacy of rotenone treatment. RNAscope in situ hybridization revealed decreased PACAP mRNA (<i>Adcyap1</i>) and PAC1R mRNA (<i>Adcyap1r1</i>) expression in the CPu, globus pallidus, dopaminergic SNpc and peptidergic EWcp of rotenone-treated rats, but no remarkable downregulation occurred in the insular cortex. In the entopeduncular nucleus, only the <i>Adcyap1r1</i> mRNA was downregulated in parkinsonian animals. B/L therapy attenuated the downregulation of <i>Adcyap1</i> in the CPu only. Our current results further support the evolutionarily conserved role of the PACAP/PAC1R system in neuroprotection and its recruitment in the development/progression of neurodegenerative states such as PD.
