Title: Diet quality and Parkinson's disease: Potential strategies for non-motor symptom management.
PMID: 37611510

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is now considered a systemic disease, and some phenotypes may be modifiable by diet. We will compare the diet quality and intake of specific nutrients and food groups of PD patients with household and community controls to examine how diet may influence PD clinical features.
