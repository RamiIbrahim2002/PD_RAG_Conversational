Title: Genetic meta-analysis of levodopa induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37425912

Abstract:
Forty percent of Parkinson's disease patients develop levodopa-induced-dyskinesia (LiD) within 4 years of starting levodopa. The genetic basis of LiD remains poorly understood, and there have been few well powered studies.
