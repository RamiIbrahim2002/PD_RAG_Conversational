PMID: 37508925

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive central nervous system disease with a common motor symptom of gait disturbance in PD, which is more pronounced in the later stages. Although FDA-approved treatments, including dopaminergic pharmacotherapy, deep brain stimulation, and rehabilitation, have some benefits in improving gait dysfunction, a fair amount of advanced PD patients can develop a disability, social isolation, and high mortality and morbidity. Recently, clinicians and scientists have applied music to clinical therapy, namely music therapy. It has been used as a unique rehabilitation tool to improve PD-induced gait and speech disorders. Based on relevant studies in recent years, this paper reviews the published literature about music in treating gait disorders and speech problems in PD patients. Additionally, we discuss current studies' limitations and emphasize the future potential research fields.
