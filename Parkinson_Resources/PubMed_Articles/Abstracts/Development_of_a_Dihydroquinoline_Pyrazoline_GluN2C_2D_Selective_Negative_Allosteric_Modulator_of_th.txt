Abstract:
Subunit-selective inhibition of <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is a promising therapeutic strategy for several neurological disorders, including epilepsy, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, depression, and acute brain injury. We previously described the dihydroquinoline-pyrazoline (DQP) analogue <b>2a</b> (<b>DQP-26</b>) as a potent NMDAR negative allosteric modulator with selectivity for GluN2C/D over GluN2A/B. However, moderate (<100-fold) subunit selectivity, inadequate cell-membrane permeability, and poor brain penetration complicated the use of <b>2a</b> as an <i>in vivo</i> probe. In an effort to improve selectivity and the pharmacokinetic profile of the series, we performed additional structure-activity relationship studies of the succinate side chain and investigated the use of prodrugs to mask the pendant carboxylic acid. These efforts led to discovery of the analogue (<i>S</i>)-(-)-<b>2i</b>, also referred to as (<i>S</i>)-(-)-<b>DQP-997</b>-<b>74</b>, which exhibits >100- and >300-fold selectivity for GluN2C- and GluN2D-containing NMDARs (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.069 and 0.035 μM, respectively) compared to GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing receptors (IC<sub>50</sub> 5.2 and 16 μM, respectively) and has no effects on AMPA, kainate, or GluN1/GluN3 receptors. Compound (<i>S</i>)-(-)-<b>2i</b> is 5-fold more potent than (<i>S</i>)-<b>2a</b>. In addition, compound <b>2i</b> shows a time-dependent enhancement of inhibitory actions at GluN2C- and GluN2D-containing NMDARs in the presence of the agonist glutamate, which could attenuate hypersynchronous activity driven by high-frequency excitatory synaptic transmission. Consistent with this finding, compound <b>2i</b> significantly reduced the number of epileptic events in a murine model of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-induced epilepsy that is associated with upregulation of the GluN2C subunit. Thus, <b>2i</b> represents a robust tool for the GluN2C/D target validation. Esterification of the succinate carboxylate improved brain penetration, suggesting a strategy for therapeutic development of this series for NMDAR-associated neurological conditions.
