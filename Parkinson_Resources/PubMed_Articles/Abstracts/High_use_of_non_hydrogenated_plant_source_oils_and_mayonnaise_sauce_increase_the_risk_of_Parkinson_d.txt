PMID: 37997257

Abstract:
<b>Objectives:</b> This study aimed to assess the contribution of edible/cooking oils and mayonnaise sauce in the severity, motor and non-motor symptoms, and risk of Parkinson's disease (PD).<b>Methods:</b> In this study, 120 patients with PD and 50 healthy individuals participated. The frequency and quantity of edible/cooking oils including animal and plant source oils (hydrogenated and nonhydrogenated) and mayonnaise sauce used by participants were determined using a food frequency questionnaire. The severity of PD was determined by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).<b>Results:</b> Patients with PD had lower use of hydrogenated plant-based oil (HPO) (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and animal oils (<i>p</i> < 0.001) but had higher use of non-hydrogenated plant-based oil (NHPO) (<i>p</i> < 0.001), olive oil (<i>p</i> = 0.02), and mayonnaise sauce (<i>p</i> < 0.001) compared with the healthy subjects. Use of each unit HPO reduced 4% the odds of PD (<i>p</i> = 0.01). The odds of PD increased 20% by each unit increase in NHPO usage (<i>p</i> = 0.001), 49% by olive oil (<i>p</i> = 0.02), and 127% by mayonnaise sauce (<i>p</i> = 0.004) intake. According to receiver operator characteristics curve analysis, mayonnaise sauce and NHPO had the largest area under the curve in predicting PD. Intake of animal oil was positively correlated with total score of UPDRS (<i>p</i> = 0.05) and motor symptoms (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Intake of butter was positively correlated with total score of UPDRS (<i>p</i> = 0.047), nonmotor aspects of experiences of daily living (<i>p</i> = 0.02), and motor examination (<i>p</i> = 0.02).<b>Discussion:</b> The findings indicate that high intake of HPO reduces, while high intake of NHPO, olive oil, and mayonnaise sauce increases the odds of PD.
