Title: Suitability of visual cues for freezing of gait in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease: a case-control pilot study.
PMID: 37464390

Abstract:
Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most debilitating symptoms in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Visual cues can relieve FOG symptoms. However, there is no consensus on patient characteristics that can benefit from visual cues. Therefore, we examined the differences in IPD patient characteristics according to the effectiveness of visual cueing.
