Title: Paradoxical Modulation of STN β-Band Activity with Medication Compared to Deep Brain Stimulation.
PMID: 37888906

Abstract:
Excessive subthalamic nucleus (STN) β-band (13-35 Hz) synchronized oscillations has garnered interest as a biomarker for characterizing disease state and developing adaptive stimulation systems for Parkinson's disease (PD).
