Title: Cardiac 123I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) Scintigraphy in Parkinson's Disease: A Comprehensive Review.
PMID: 37891838

Abstract:
Cardiac sympathetic denervation, as documented on 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy, is relatively sensitive and specific for distinguishing Parkinson's disease (PD) from other neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism. The present study aims to comprehensively review the literature regarding the use of cardiac MIBG in PD. MIBG is an analog to norepinephrine. They share the same uptake, storage, and release mechanisms. An abnormal result in the cardiac MIBG uptake in individuals with parkinsonism can be an additional criterion for diagnosing PD. However, a normal result of cardiac MIBG in individuals with suspicious parkinsonian syndrome does not exclude the diagnosis of PD. The findings of cardiac MIBG studies contributed to elucidating the pathophysiology of PD. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of cardiac MIBG scintigraphy in PD. A total of 54 studies with 3114 individuals diagnosed with PD were included. The data were described as means with a Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2.5 and early and delayed registration H/M ratios of 1.70 and 1.51, respectively. The mean cutoff for the early and delayed phases were 1.89 and 1.86. The sensitivity for the early and delayed phases was 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. The specificity for the early and delayed phases were 0.86 and 0.80, respectively.
