Abstract:
Since the number of aged people will increase in the next years, neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's Disease (PD), will also rise. Recently, we demonstrated that autophagy stimulation with rapamycin decreases dopaminergic neuronal death mediated by oxidative stress in the paraquat (PQ)-induced PD model. Assessing the neurotherapeutic efficacy of autophagy-inducing molecules is critical for preventing or delaying neurodegeneration. Therefore, we evaluated the autophagy inducers metformin and trehalose effect in a PD model. Autophagy induced by both molecules was confirmed in the SH-SY5Y dopaminergic cells by detecting increased LC3-II marker and autophagosome number compared to the control by western blot and transmission electron microscopy. Both autophagy inducers showed an antioxidant effect, improved mitochondrial activity, and decreased dopaminergic cell death induced by PQ. Next, we evaluated the effect of both inducers in vivo. C57BL6 mice were pretreated with metformin or trehalose before PQ administration. Cognitive and motor deteriorated functions in the PD model were evaluated through the nest building and the gait tests and were prevented by metformin and trehalose. Both autophagy inducers significantly reduced the dopaminergic neuronal loss, astrocytosis, and microgliosis induced by PQ. Also, cell death mediated by PQ was prevented by metformin and trehalose, assessed by TUNEL assay. Metformin and trehalose induced autophagy through AMPK phosphorylation and decreased Î±-synuclein accumulation. Therefore, metformin and trehalose are promising neurotherapeutic autophagy inducers with great potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases such as PD.
