PMID: 37987096

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most rapidly increasing movement disorder globally. Physical therapies improve the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth was the primary method of physical therapy service adaptation in response to restrictions preventing in-person therapy attendance. This study explores the perspectives of people with PD and their therapists who experienced physical therapy service delivery before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne, Australia.
