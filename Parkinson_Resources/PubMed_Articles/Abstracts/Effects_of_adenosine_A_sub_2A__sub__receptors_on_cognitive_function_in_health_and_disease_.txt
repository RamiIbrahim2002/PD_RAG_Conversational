Title: Effects of adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors on cognitive function in health and disease.
PMID: 37741689

Abstract:
Adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors have been studied extensively in the context of motor function and movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. In addition to these roles, A<sub>2A</sub> receptors have also been increasingly implicated in cognitive function and cognitive impairments in diverse conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, acute brain injury, and stress. We review the roles of A<sub>2A</sub> receptors in cognitive processes in health and disease, focusing primarily on the effects of reducing or enhancing A<sub>2A</sub> expression levels or activities in animal models. Studies reveal that A<sub>2A</sub> receptors in neurons and astrocytes modulate multiple aspects of cognitive function, including memory and motivation. Converging evidence also indicates that A<sub>2A</sub> receptor levels and activities are aberrantly increased in aging, acute brain injury, and chronic disorders, and these increases contribute to neurocognitive impairments. Therapeutically targeting A<sub>2A</sub> receptors with selective modulators may alleviate cognitive deficits in diverse neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. Further research on the exact neural mechanisms of these effects as well as the efficacy of selective A<sub>2A</sub> modulators on cognitive alterations in humans are important areas for future investigation.
