Abstract:
Movement disorder Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world after Alzheimer's disease, which severely affects the quality of patients' lives and imposes an increasingly heavy socioeconomic burden. Aureusidin is a kind of natural flavonoid compound with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities, while its pharmacological action and mechanism are rarely reported in PD. This study aimed to explore the neuroprotective effects and potential mechanisms of Aureusidin in PD. The present study demonstrated that Aureusidin protected SH-SY5Y cells from cell damage induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) via inhibiting the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and activating the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway. Additionally, Aureusidin diminished dopaminergic (DA) neuron degeneration induced by 6-OHDA and reduced the aggregation toxicity of α-synuclein (α-Syn) in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans.) In conclusion, Aureusidin showed a neuroprotective effect in the 6-OHDA-induced PD model via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway and prevented mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway, and these findings suggested that Aureusidin may be an effective drug for the treatment of PD.
