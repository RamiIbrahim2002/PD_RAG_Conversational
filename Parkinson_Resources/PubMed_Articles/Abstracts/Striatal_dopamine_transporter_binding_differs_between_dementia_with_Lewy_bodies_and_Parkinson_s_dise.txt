Abstract:
<sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a highly sensitive and established neuroimaging technique for parkinsonian syndromes (PS). However, differentiating PS by visual inspection or analysis of regions of interest is challenging. To date, image analysis has not been able to differentiate dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). This study aimed to differentiate PS based on the characteristics of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding using voxel-based analysis. We acquired <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane SPECT data from patients with DLB (n = 30), Parkinson's disease (PD; n = 122), PDD (n = 19), multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P; n = 18), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n = 45). DAT binding was reduced in the posterior striatum of patients with PD and PDD, whereas it was similar in MSA-P, PSP, and DLB. Hippocampal atrophy, visually evaluated by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, did not affect striatal DAT binding in DLB. DAT binding in the anterior striatum was inversely correlated with the severity of parkinsonism in PD and PDD but not in DLB. Thus, the appearance of striatal DAT binding might indicate different pathological processes in DLB and PDD.
