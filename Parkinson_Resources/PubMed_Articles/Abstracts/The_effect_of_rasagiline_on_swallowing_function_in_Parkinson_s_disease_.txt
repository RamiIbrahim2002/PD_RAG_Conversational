Title: The effect of rasagiline on swallowing function in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38187336

Abstract:
Dysphagia, a potentially fatal symptom of Parkinson's disease, is characterized by frequent silent aspiration, a risk factor for aspiration pneumonia. The transdermal dopamine agonist rotigotine alleviates dysphagia in patients with Parkinson's disease and is more effective than oral levodopa, suggesting the importance of continuous dopaminergic stimulation during swallowing. Rasagiline is a monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitor that facilitates continuous dopaminergic stimulation. We hypothesized that MAOB inhibition by rasagiline would be effective in improving swallowing function in patients with early- and mid-to late-stage Parkinson's disease. To this end, we performed an analytical observational study to determine the effects of rasagiline (1 mg/day) on swallowing function using videofluoroscopic swallowing study. This open-label, evaluator-blinded study enrolled 32 patients with Parkinson's disease, among whom 19 were drug-naïve and 13 were receiving add-on therapy. Our results showed that rasagiline significantly improved all swallowing measures during the oral and pharyngeal phases, including oral transit time and pharyngeal transit time, in all enrolled patients. Similar results were found in drug-naïve and mid-to late-stage patients, with no intergroup differences. In conclusion, drugs capable of continuous dopaminergic stimulation may effectively improve swallowing function in patients with Parkinson's disease, with similar effects in early- and mid-to late-stage Parkinson's disease. This study has been the first to show that rasagiline significantly improves swallowing function in mid-to late-stage patients receiving add-on therapy.
