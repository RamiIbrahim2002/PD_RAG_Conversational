Title: Long-term effects of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation on speech in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37454168

Abstract:
Bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment in advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, the effects of STN-DBS on speech are still debated, particularly in the long-term follow-up. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of bilateral STN-DBS on speech in a cohort of advanced PD patients treated with bilateral STN-DBS. Each patient was assessed before surgery through a neurological evaluation and a perceptual-acoustic analysis of speech and re-assessed in the long-term in different stimulation and drug conditions. The primary outcome was the percentage change of speech intelligibility obtained by comparing the postoperative on-stimulation/off-medication condition with the preoperative off-medication condition. Twenty-five PD patients treated with bilateral STN-DBS with a 5-year follow-up were included. In the long-term, speech intelligibility stayed at the same level as preoperative values when compared with preoperative values. STN-DBS induced a significant acute improvement of speech intelligibility (p < 0.005) in the postoperative assessment when compared to the on-stimulation/off-medication and off-stimulation/off-medication conditions. These results highlight that STN-DBS may handle speech intelligibility even in the long-term.
