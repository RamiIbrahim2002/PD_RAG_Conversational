Title: Clinical biomarkers for Lewy body diseases.
PMID: 37964309

Abstract:
Synucleinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by pathologic aggregates of neural and glial α-synuclein (α-syn) in the form of Lewy bodies (LBs), Lewy neurites, and cytoplasmic inclusions in both neurons and glia. Two major classes of synucleinopathies are LB disease and multiple system atrophy. LB diseases include Parkinson's disease (PD), PD with dementia, and dementia with LBs. All are increasing in prevalence. Effective diagnostics, disease-modifying therapies, and therapeutic monitoring are urgently needed. Diagnostics capable of differentiating LB diseases are based on signs and symptoms which might overlap. To date, no specific diagnostic test exists despite disease-specific pathologies. Diagnostics are aided by brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid evaluations, but more accessible biomarkers remain in need. Mechanisms of α-syn evolution to pathologic oligomers and insoluble fibrils can provide one of a spectrum of biomarkers to link complex neural pathways to effective therapies. With these in mind, we review promising biomarkers linked to effective disease-modifying interventions.
