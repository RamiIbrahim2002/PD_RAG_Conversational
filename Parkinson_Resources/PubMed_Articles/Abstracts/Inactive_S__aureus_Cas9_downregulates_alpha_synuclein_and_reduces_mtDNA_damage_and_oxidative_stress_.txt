Title: Inactive S. aureus Cas9 downregulates alpha-synuclein and reduces mtDNA damage and oxidative stress levels in human stem cell model of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37853101

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, but no disease modifying therapies have been successful in clinical translation presenting a major unmet medical need. A promising target is alpha-synuclein or its aggregated form, which accumulates in the brain of PD patients as Lewy bodies. While it is not entirely clear which alpha-synuclein protein species is disease relevant, mere overexpression of alpha-synuclein in hereditary forms leads to neurodegeneration. To specifically address gene regulation of alpha-synuclein, we developed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system based on the nuclease dead S. aureus Cas9 (SadCas9) fused with the transcriptional repressor domain Krueppel-associated box to controllably repress alpha-synuclein expression at the transcriptional level. We screened single guide (sg)RNAs across the SNCA promoter and identified several sgRNAs that mediate downregulation of alpha-synuclein at varying levels. CRISPRi downregulation of alpha-synuclein in iPSC-derived neuronal cultures from a patient with an SNCA genomic triplication showed functional recovery by reduction of oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA damage. Our results are proof-of-concept in vitro for precision medicine by targeting the SNCA gene promoter. The SNCA CRISPRi approach presents a new model to understand safe levels of alpha-synuclein downregulation and a novel therapeutic strategy for PD and related alpha-synucleinopathies.
