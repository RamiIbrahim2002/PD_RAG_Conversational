Title: A fast and non-invasive artificial intelligence olfactory-like system that aids diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38009830

Abstract:
Several previous studies have shown that skin sebum analysis can be used to diagnose Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this study was to develop a portable artificial intelligence olfactory-like (AIO) system based on gas chromatographic analysis of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in patient sebum and explore its application value in the diagnosis of PD.
