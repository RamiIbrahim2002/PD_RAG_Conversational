PMID: 37561080

Abstract:
The heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease (PD) is evident from descriptions of non-motor (NMS) subtypes and Park Sleep, originally identified by Sauerbier et al. 2016, is one such clinical subtype associated with the predominant clinical presentation of sleep dysfunctions including excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), along with insomnia.
