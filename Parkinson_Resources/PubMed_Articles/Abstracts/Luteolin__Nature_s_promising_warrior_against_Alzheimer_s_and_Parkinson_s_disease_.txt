Title: Luteolin: Nature's promising warrior against Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38091364

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are defined as the slow loss of a group of neurons that are particularly sensitive. Due to the intricate pathophysiological processes underlying neurodegeneration, no cure exists for these conditions despite the extensive research and advances in our knowledge of the onset and course of NDs. Hence, there is a medical need for the creation of a novel therapeutic approach for NDs. By focusing on numerous signaling pathways, some natural substances derived from medicinal herbs and foods have demonstrated potent activity in treating various NDs. In this context, flavonoids have recently attracted increased popularity and research attention because of their alleged beneficial effects on health. By acting as antioxidant substances, nutritional supplements made up of flavonoids have been found to lessen the extent of NDs like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Luteolin is a flavone that possesses potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. As a consequence, luteolin has emerged as an option for treatment with therapeutic effects on many brain disorders. More research has focused on luteolin's diverse biological targets as well as diverse signaling pathways, implying its potential medicinal properties in several NDs. This review emphasizes the possible use of luteolin as a drug of choice for the treatment as well as the management of AD and PD. In addition, this review recommends that further research should be carried out on luteolin as a potential treatment for AD and PD alongside a focus on mechanisms and clinical studies.
