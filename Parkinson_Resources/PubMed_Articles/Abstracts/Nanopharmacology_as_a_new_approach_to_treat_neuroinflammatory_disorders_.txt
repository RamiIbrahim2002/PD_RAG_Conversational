Title: Nanopharmacology as a new approach to treat neuroinflammatory disorders.
PMID: 38152092

Abstract:
Neuroinflammation, a complex process involving the activation of microglia, astrocytes, and other immune cells in the brain, plays a role in neurodegeneration and psychiatric disorders. Current therapeutic strategies for neuroinflammation are limited, necessitating the development of improved approaches. Nanopharmacology offers unprecedented opportunities to access and treat neuroinflammatory disorders at the brain level. Nanoscaffolds can target specific cells or tissues and protect drugs from degradation or elimination, making them ideal candidates for treating neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Recent advancements in nanoparticle development have enabled the targeting of microglia, astrocytes, and other immune cells in the brain, reducing neuroinflammation and protecting neurons from injury. Nanoparticles targeting specific neurons have also been developed. Clinical trials are in progress to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nano drugs for treating neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric diseases. The successful development of these nanodrugs holds immense promise for treating these devastating and increasingly prevalent conditions. On the other hand, several limitations and unanswered questions remain. First, the long-term effects of nanoparticles on the brain need to be thoroughly investigated to ensure their safety. Second, optimizing the targeting and delivery of nanoparticles to specific brain regions remains a challenge. Understanding the complex interplay between nanoparticles and the brain's immune system is crucial for developing effective nanotherapies. Despite these limitations, nanopharmacology presents a transformative approach to treating neuroinflammatory disorders. Future research should address the aforementioned limitations and further elucidate the mechanisms of nanoparticle-mediated therapy. The successful development of safe and effective nanodrugs can revolutionize the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders, alleviating the suffering of millions.
