Title: Objective assessment of the effects of opicapone in Parkinson's disease through kinematic analysis.
PMID: 38091213

Abstract:
Opicapone (OPC) is a third-generation, selective peripheral COMT inhibitor that improves peripheral L-DOPA bioavailability and reduces OFF time and end-of-dose motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.
