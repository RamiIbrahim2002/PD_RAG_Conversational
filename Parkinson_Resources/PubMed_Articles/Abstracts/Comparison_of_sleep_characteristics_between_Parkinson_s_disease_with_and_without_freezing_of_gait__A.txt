Title: Comparison of sleep characteristics between Parkinson's disease with and without freezing of gait: A systematic review.
PMID: 38150950

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a range of motor and non-motor symptoms. Among the motor complaints, freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and disabling phenomenon that episodically hinders patients' ability to produce efficient steps. Concurrently, sleep disorders are prevalent in PD and significantly impact the quality of life of affected individuals. Numerous studies have suggested a bidirectional relationship between FOG and sleep disorders. Therefore, our objective was to systematically review the literature and compare sleep outcomes in PD patients with FOG (PD + FOG) and those without FOG (PD-FOG). By conducting a comprehensive search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases, we identified 20 eligible studies for inclusion in our analysis. Our review revealed that compared to PD-FOG, PD + FOG patients exhibited more severe symptoms of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in nine studies, increased daytime sleepiness in eight studies, decreased sleep quality in four studies, and more frequent and severe sleep disturbances in four studies. These findings indicate that PD + FOG patients generally experience worse sleep quality, higher levels of daytime sleepiness, and more disruptive sleep disturbances compared to those without FOG (PD-FOG). The association between sleep disturbances and FOG highlights the importance of evaluating and monitoring these symptoms in PD patients and open the possibility for future studies to assess the impact of managing sleep disturbances on the severity and occurrence of FOG, and vice versa.
