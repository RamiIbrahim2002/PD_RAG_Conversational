Title: The Landscape of Monogenic Parkinson's Disease in Populations of Non-European Ancestry: A Narrative Review.
PMID: 38003040

Abstract:
There has been a bias in the existing literature on Parkinson's disease (PD) genetics as most studies involved patients of European ancestry, mostly in Europe and North America. Our target was to review published research data on the genetic profile of PD patients of non-European or mixed ancestry.
