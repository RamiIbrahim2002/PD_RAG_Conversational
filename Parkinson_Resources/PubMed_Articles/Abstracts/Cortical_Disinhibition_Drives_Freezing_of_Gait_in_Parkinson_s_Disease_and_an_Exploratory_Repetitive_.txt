Title: Cortical Disinhibition Drives Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease and an Exploratory Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Study.
PMID: 37646183

Abstract:
Dysfunction of the primary motor cortex, participating in regulation of posture and gait, is implicated in freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD).
