Title: Gouty tenosynovitis with compartment syndrome in the hand: A case report.
PMID: 37969458

Abstract:
Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints and surrounding tissues. It typically appears with abrupt and intense pain, redness, and swelling in the affected joint. It frequently targets the lower extremities, such as the big toe. However, rarely, gout can manifest in atypical locations, including the hands, leading to an uncommon presentation known as gouty tenosynovitis. However, it can result in significant morbidity owing to the potential for severe complications, such as myonecrosis and compartment syndrome.
