PMID: 37814245

Abstract:
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a common neurological condition that often causes stiffness, tremor and slow movement. People living with PD are likely to encounter nursing students throughout their journey from pre-diagnosis to death. Despite this, there is a paucity of evidence about current practice in PD education amongst nursing students. The present study provides an evaluation of a co-designed Parkinson's Awareness audio podcast amongst nursing students in Northern Ireland.
