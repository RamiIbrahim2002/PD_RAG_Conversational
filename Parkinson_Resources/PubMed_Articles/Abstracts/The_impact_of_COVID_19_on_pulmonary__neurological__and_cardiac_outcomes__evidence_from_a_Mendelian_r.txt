PMID: 38155884

Abstract:
Long COVID is a clinical entity characterized by persistent health problems or development of new diseases, without an alternative diagnosis, following SARS-CoV-2 infection that affects a significant proportion of individuals globally. It can manifest with a wide range of symptoms due to dysfunction of multiple organ systems including but not limited to cardiovascular, hematologic, neurological, gastrointestinal, and renal organs, revealed by observational studies. However, a causal association between the genetic predisposition to COVID-19 and many post-infective abnormalities in long COVID remain unclear.
