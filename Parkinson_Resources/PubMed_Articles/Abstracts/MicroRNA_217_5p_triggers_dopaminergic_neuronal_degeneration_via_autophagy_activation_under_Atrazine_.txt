Title: MicroRNA-217-5p triggers dopaminergic neuronal degeneration via autophagy activation under Atrazine exposure.
PMID: 37890694

Abstract:
Atrazine (ATR) is a widely used agricultural herbicide, and its accumulation in soil and water can cause various environmental health problems. ATR has neurotoxic effects on dopaminergic neurons, which can lead to a Parkinson's disease (PD)-like syndrome. Epigenetics regulates gene expression dynamically through DNA methylation, histone post-translational modification, microRNA (miRNA) interaction, and RNA methylation. MicroRNA (miRNA), representing one of the primary epigenetic mechanisms responsible for regulating gene expression, plays a crucial role in maintaining normal cellular function, while dysregulation of miRNA expression has been observed in PD. This study aims to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of miRNA in ATR exposure. The results show that ATR-exposure significantly upregulates the expression level of miR-217-5p. Both miR-217-5p overexpression and ATR exposure is able to trigger the autophagy process and apoptosis. Conversely, inhibiting the expression of miR-217-5p can reverse the levels of ATR-induced autophagy and apoptosis. Moreover, ATR causes damage to dopaminergic neurons, as indicated by the altered expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and Î±-synuclein. Taken together, these results suggest that ATR-induced autophagy can accelerate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and that miR-217-5p is probably an important target involved in ATR-induced dopaminergic damage, shedding important light on the development of a novel strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases.
