PMID: 38043936

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to various motor and non-motor symptoms. Several cellular and molecular mechanisms such as alpha-synuclein (Î±-syn) accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. They are typically about 21-25 nucleotides in length and are involved in the regulation of gene expression by binding to the messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. miRNAs like miR-221 play important roles in various biological processes, including development, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. miR-221 promotes neuronal survival against oxidative stress and neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation. Additionally, the role of miR-221 in PD has been investigated in several studies. According to the results of these studies, (1) miR-221 protects PC12 cells against oxidative stress induced by 6-hydroxydopamine; (2) miR-221 prevents Bax/caspase-3 signalling activation by stopping Bim; (3) miR-221 has moderate predictive power for PD; (4) miR-221 directly targets PTEN, and PTEN over-expression eliminates the protective action of miR-221 on p-AKT expression in PC12 cells; and (5) miRNA-221 controls cell viability and apoptosis by manipulating the Akt signalling pathway in PD. This review study suggested that miR-221 has the potential to be used as a clinical biomarker for PD diagnosis and stage assignment.
