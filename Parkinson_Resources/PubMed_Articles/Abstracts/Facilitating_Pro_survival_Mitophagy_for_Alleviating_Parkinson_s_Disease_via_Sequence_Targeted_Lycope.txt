Title: Facilitating Pro-survival Mitophagy for Alleviating Parkinson's Disease via Sequence-Targeted Lycopene Nanodots.
PMID: 37714739

Abstract:
The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is closely linked to impaired mitochondrial function and abnormal mitophagy. Biocompatible natural antioxidants effectively protect dopaminergic neurons. However, the main challenge in using natural antioxidants for Parkinson's disease therapy is creating a delivery platform to achieve neuron-targeted enrichment. Herein, we synthesized rationally sequence-targeted lycopene nanodots using recombinant human H-ferritin nanocages with lycopene loading into the cavity and lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) coupling on the outer surface. The nanodots allow for the neural enrichment and mitochondrial regulation of lycopene through blood-brain barrier transcytosis and neuronal mitochondria-targeting capability. These anti-ROS nanodots protect neuronal mitochondrial function and promote PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in MPTP toxicity-induced neurons <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>, which favors the secretory efflux of pathogenic Î±-synuclein and the survival of dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, these nanodots restore the Parkinson-like motor symptoms in Parkinson's model mice. This noninvasive sequence-targeted delivery strategy with excellent biocompatibility for pro-survival mitophagy-mediated pathology alleviation makes it a promising approach for treating and preventing Parkinson's disease.
