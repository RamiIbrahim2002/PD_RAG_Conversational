Title: Insole Systems for Disease Diagnosis and Rehabilitation: A Review.
PMID: 37622919

Abstract:
Some chronic diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), diabetic foot, flat foot, stroke, elderly falling, and knee osteoarthritis (KOA), are related to orthopedic organs, nerves, and muscles. The interaction of these three parts will generate a comprehensive result: gait. Furthermore, the lesions in these regions can produce abnormal gait features. Therefore, monitoring the gait features can assist medical professionals in the diagnosis and analysis of these diseases. Nowadays, various insole systems based on different sensing techniques have been developed to monitor gait and aid in medical research. Hence, a detailed review of insole systems and their applications in disease management can greatly benefit researchers working in the field of medical engineering. This essay is composed of the following sections: the essay firstly provides an overview of the sensing mechanisms and parameters of typical insole systems based on different sensing techniques. Then this essay respectively discusses the three stages of gait parameters pre-processing, respectively: pressure reconstruction, feature extraction, and data normalization. Then, the relationship between gait features and pathogenic mechanisms is discussed, along with the introduction of insole systems that aid in medical research; Finally, the current challenges and future trends in the development of insole systems are discussed.
