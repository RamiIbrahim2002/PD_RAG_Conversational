Title: Assessment of Knowledge and Perception Regarding Deep Brain Stimulation Among Medical Students in Saudi Arabia.
PMID: 37559853

Abstract:
Â Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure approved for treating psychiatric and movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), essential tremor, dystonia, and other neurological conditions. The widespread use of DBS may not be reflected in the medical education curricula in Saudi universities, thus jeopardizing future patients' access to it. This study aims to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of medical students toward DBS as a therapeutic option.
