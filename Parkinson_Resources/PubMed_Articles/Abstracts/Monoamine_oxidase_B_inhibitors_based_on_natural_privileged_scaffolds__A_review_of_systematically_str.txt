Title: Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors based on natural privileged scaffolds: A review of systematically structural modification.
PMID: 37549764

Abstract:
Monoamine oxidase is a flavin enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain. Various toxic by-products, aldehydes and hydrogen peroxide produced during the catalytic process, can cause oxidative stress and neuronal cell death. Overexpression of MAO-B and insufficient dopamine concentration are recognized as pathological factors in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the inhibition of MAO-B is an attractive target for the treatment of NDs. Despite significant efforts, few selective and reversible MAO-B inhibitors have been clinically approved. Natural products have emerged as valuable sources of lead compounds in drug discovery. Compounds such as chromone, coumarin, chalcone, caffeine, and aurone, present in natural structures, are considered as privileged scaffolds in the synthesis of MAO-B inhibitors. In this review, we summarized the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of MAO-B inhibitors based on the naturally privileged scaffolds over the past 20Â years. Additionally, we proposed a balanced discussion on the advantages and limitations of natural scaffold-based MAO-B inhibitors with providing a future perspective in drug development.
