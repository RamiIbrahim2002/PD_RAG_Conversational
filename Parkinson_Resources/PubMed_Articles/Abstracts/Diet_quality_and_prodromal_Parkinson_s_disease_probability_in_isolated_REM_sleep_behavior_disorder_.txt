Title: Diet quality and prodromal Parkinson's disease probability in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder.
PMID: 37549588

Abstract:
It is reported that a diet that lowers oxidative stress reduces the prodromal Parkinson's disease (pPD) probability as well as the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we evaluated whether the diet quality of patients with isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) were associated with the pPD probability score, PD risk markers, or prodromal markers.
