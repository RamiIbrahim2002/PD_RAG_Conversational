Title: Abscisic acid ameliorates motor disabilities in 6-OHDA-induced mice model of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37576242

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a myriad of symptoms, encompassing both motor disabilities and cognitive impairments. Recent research has shown that abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone found in various brain regions of several mammals and exhibits neuroprotective properties. To investigate the effects of ABA on cognitive and motor disorders, a mouse model of PD was utilized. The administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to the lateral ventricles was conducted, with ABA (10 and 15 μg/mouse, i. c.v.) being administered for one week after the 6-OHDA injection for 4 days. Motor and cognitive performance were evaluated through the use of open field, rotarod, wire grip, and shuttle box tests. The results indicated that cognitive function and motor disorders were significantly impaired in 6-OHDA-treated animals. However, in mice treated with 6-OHDA, ABA (15 μg/mouse) significantly reversed balance and muscle strength deficits. It should be noted that the administration of ABA did not significantly improve cognitive impairment or rearing in Parkinsonism mice. Therefore, the findings suggest that ABA plays a crucial role in protecting mice from motor disabilities caused by 6-OHDA.
