Title: Cholinergic basal forebrain system degeneration underlies postural instability/gait difficulty and attention impairment in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37877681

Abstract:
The specific pathophysiological mechanisms underlying postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) and cognitive function in Parkinson's disease (PD) remain unclear. Both postural and gait control, as well as cognitive function, are associated with the cholinergic basal forebrain (cBF) system.
