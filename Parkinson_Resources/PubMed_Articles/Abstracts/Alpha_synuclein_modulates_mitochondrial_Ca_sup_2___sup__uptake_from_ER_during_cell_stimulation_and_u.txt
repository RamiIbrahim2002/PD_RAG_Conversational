Title: Alpha synuclein modulates mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake from ER during cell stimulation and under stress conditions.
PMID: 37741841

Abstract:
Alpha synuclein (a-syn) is an intrinsically disordered protein prevalent in neurons, and aggregated forms are associated with synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the biomedical importance and extensive studies, the physiological role of a-syn and its participation in etiology of PD remain uncertain. We showed previously in model RBL cells that a-syn colocalizes with mitochondrial membranes, depending on formation of N-terminal helices and increasing with mitochondrial stress<sup>1</sup>. We have now characterized this colocalization and functional correlates in RBL, HEK293, and N2a cells. We find that expression of a-syn enhances stimulated mitochondrial uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER, depending on formation of its N-terminal helices but not on its disordered C-terminal tail. Our results are consistent with a-syn acting as a tether between mitochondria and ER, and we show increased contacts between these two organelles using structured illumination microscopy. We tested mitochondrial stress caused by toxins related to PD, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP/MPP+) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) and found that a-syn prevents recovery of stimulated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. The C-terminal tail, and not N-terminal helices, is involved in this inhibitory activity, which is abrogated when phosphorylation site serine-129 is mutated (S129A). Correspondingly, we find that MPTP/MPP+ and CCCP stress is accompanied by both phosphorylation (pS129) and aggregation of a-syn. Overall, our results indicate that a-syn can participate as a tethering protein to modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux between ER and mitochondria, with potential physiological significance. A-syn can also prevent cellular recovery from toxin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, which may represent a pathological role of a-syn in the etiology of PD.
