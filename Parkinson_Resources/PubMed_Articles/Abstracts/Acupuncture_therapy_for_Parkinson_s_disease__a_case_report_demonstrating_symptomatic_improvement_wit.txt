Title: Acupuncture therapy for Parkinson's disease: a case report demonstrating symptomatic improvement without medication.
PMID: 38348115

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) often necessitates immediate medical intervention following diagnosis. In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in clinical investigations assessing the efficacy of acupuncture in PD, with many studies reporting positive outcomes. Ethical guidelines commonly endorse pharmaceutical therapies for PD, leading ongoing research to combine acupuncture with standard drug-based treatments. At present, there is a conspicuous absence of dedicated clinical research exclusively examining the independent impact of acupuncture on PD treatment.
