Title: Pimavanserin Use in Lewy Body Dementia: A Case Report Demonstrating the Medication's Efficacy.
PMID: 37920617

Abstract:
Pimavanserin is an antipsychotic that is approved for use in Parkinson's disease psychosis. Working as a serotonin 2A inverse agonist, pimavanserin allows patients to improve their psychotic symptoms without worsening the motor symptoms of Parkinson's. This mechanism is mediated via serotonin receptors and may allow for pimavanserin to be considered for use in other disease processes that present with psychosis. Here, the authors describe the case of a 75-year-old man with Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) who was started on pimavanserin. The response of the patient to the medication was measured over a six-week time course using the Scales for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms of Schizophrenia (SAPS). Overall, pimavanserin was shown to be effective in this patient with LBD. The authors also provide a review of the sparse literature attesting to other off-label uses for this unique antipsychotic.
