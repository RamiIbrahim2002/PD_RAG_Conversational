Title: Methods for evaluating gait associated dynamic balance and coordination in rodents.
PMID: 37783346

Abstract:
Balance is the dynamic and unconscious control of the body's centre of mass to maintain postural equilibrium. Regulated by the vestibular system, head movement and acceleration are processed by the brain to adjust joints. Several conditions result in a loss of balance, including Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Meni√®re's Disease and cervical spondylosis, all of which are caused by damage to certain parts of the vestibular pathways. Studies about the impairment of the vestibular system are challenging to carry out in human trials due to smaller study sizes limiting applications of the results and a lacking understanding of the human balance control mechanism. In contrast, more controlled research can be performed in animal studies which have fewer confounding factors than human models and allow specific conditions that affect balance to be replicated. Balance control can be studied using rodent balance-related behavioural tests after spinal or brain lesions, such as the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) Locomotor Scale, Foot Fault Scoring System, Ledged Beam Test, Beam Walking Test, and Ladder Beam Test, which are discussed in this review article along with their advantages and disadvantages. These tests can be performed in preclinical rodent models of femoral nerve injury, stroke, spinal cord injury and neurodegenerative diseases.
