Title: The Multiple Roles of Autophagy in Neural Function and Diseases.
PMID: 37856037

Abstract:
Autophagy involves the sequestration and delivery of cytoplasmic materials to lysosomes, where proteins, lipids, and organelles are degraded and recycled. According to the way the cytoplasmic components are engulfed, autophagy can be divided into macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy. Recently, many studies have found that autophagy plays an important role in neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, neuronal excitotoxicity, and cerebral ischemia. Autophagy maintains cell homeostasis in the nervous system via degradation of misfolded proteins, elimination of damaged organelles, and regulation of apoptosis and inflammation. AMPK-mTOR, Beclin 1, TP53, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and other signal pathways are involved in the regulation of autophagy and can be used as potential therapeutic targets for neurological diseases. Here, we discuss the role, functions, and signal pathways of autophagy in neurological diseases, which will shed light on the pathogenic mechanisms of neurological diseases and suggest novel targets for therapies.
