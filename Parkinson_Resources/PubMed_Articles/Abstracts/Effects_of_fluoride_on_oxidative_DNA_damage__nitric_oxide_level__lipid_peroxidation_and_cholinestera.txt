Title: Effects of fluoride on oxidative DNA damage, nitric oxide level, lipid peroxidation and cholinesterase enzyme activity in a rotenone-induced experimental Parkinson's model.
PMID: 37699078

Abstract:
Environmental toxins are known to be one of the important factors in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study was designed to investigate the possible contribution of fluoride (F) exposure to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in rats with PD induced by rotenone (ROT).
