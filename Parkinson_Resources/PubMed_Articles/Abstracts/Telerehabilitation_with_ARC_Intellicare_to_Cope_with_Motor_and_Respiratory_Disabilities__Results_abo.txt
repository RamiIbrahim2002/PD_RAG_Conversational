Abstract:
"Ricominciare" is a single-center, prospective, pre-/post-intervention pilot study aimed at verifying the feasibility and safety of the ARC Intellicare (ARC) system (an artificial intelligence-powered and inertial motion unit-based mobile platform) in the home rehabilitation of people with disabilities due to respiratory or neurological diseases.
