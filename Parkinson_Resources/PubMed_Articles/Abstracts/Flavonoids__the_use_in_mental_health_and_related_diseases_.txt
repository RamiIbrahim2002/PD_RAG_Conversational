Title: Flavonoids: the use in mental health and related diseases.
PMID: 37948603

Abstract:
Given the current increase in mental and neurological disorders, there is an urgent need to develop alternative treatments for patients. Flavonoids exhibit diverse biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective, and has been considered potential therapies for central nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, drug addiction, and stroke. Studies have shown that flavonoids protect neurons from oxidative stress, reduce inflammation, improve brain blood flow and enhance cognitive function. Moreover, its modulation of neurotransmission, such as GABAergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic, and noradrenergic, has been studied for the treatment of mental disorders that require sedative effects, antidepressants, sleep inducers and anxiety reduction. Although more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and potential benefits of these compounds, the use of flavonoids for neurological diseases is a promising avenue for future research and development. This review focuses on major flavonoid subclasses and their applications in central nervous system disorders.
