Title: Association of Parkinson's disease status with accelerometer-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior in older women: The Women's Health Study (WHS).
PMID: 37584064

Abstract:
Evidence suggests that individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD) spend less time in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) compared to those without PD. However, prior studies primarily included men and did not consider movement across the entire intensity spectrum. To address these gaps, the association of PD status with total volume physical activity and time spent in sedentary, low light-intensity physical activity (LLPA), high light-intensity physical activity (HLPA), and MVPA among older women was examined. This is a cross-sectional analysis of 17,466 ambulatory women enrolled in the Women's Health Study (WHS) with a median (IQR) age of 70 (67-75) years who were asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 days from 2011 to 2015 for the ancillary study. Reported PD status was assessed via annual mail-in questionnaires prior to device wear. Compared to those without PD (n = 16,661), PD (n = 80) was associated with 98,400 fewer vector magnitude (VM) counts per day and with spending an average of 23.2 more minutes per day sedentary and 10.5 more minutes per day in LLPA. Further, PD was associated with spending 6.4 and 27.3 fewer minutes per day in HLPA and MVPA, respectively, compared to women without PD. PD in women is associated with more daily sedentary time and less time spent in health-enhancing physical activity. Prevention strategies to promote physical activity should be emphasized to enhance health and limit progression of disability in women living with PD.
