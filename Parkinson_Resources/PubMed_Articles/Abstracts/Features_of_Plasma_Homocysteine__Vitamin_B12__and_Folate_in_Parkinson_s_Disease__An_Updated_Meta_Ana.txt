Title: Features of Plasma Homocysteine, Vitamin B12, and Folate in Parkinson's Disease: An Updated Meta-Analysis.
PMID: 37735121

Abstract:
Many studies have shown that the levels of homocysteine (Hcy), vitamin B12 (Vit B12), and folate (FA) are abnormal in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but the results have not been consistent. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to summarize the features of Hcy, Vit B12, and FA in PD patients.
