Title: Mitochondrial dysfunction and neurological disorders: A narrative review and treatment overview.
PMID: 37949207

Abstract:
Mitochondria play a vital role in the nervous system, as they are responsible for generating energy in the form of ATP and regulating cellular processes such as calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling and apoptosis. However, mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, and cell death, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. In this article, we review the main functions of mitochondria in the nervous system and explore the mechanisms related to mitochondrial dysfunction. We discuss the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development and progression of some neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and epilepsy. Finally, we provide an overview of various current treatment strategies that target mitochondrial dysfunction, including pharmacological treatments, phototherapy, gene therapy, and mitotherapy. This review emphasizes the importance of understanding the role of mitochondria in the nervous system and highlights the potential for mitochondrial-targeted therapies in the treatment of neurological disorders. Furthermore, it highlights some limitations and challenges encountered by the current therapeutic strategies and puts them in future perspective.
