Title: Brain Dynamics Complexity as a Signature of Cognitive Decline in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 38054573

Abstract:
Higuchi's fractal dimension (FD) captures brain dynamics complexity and may be a promising method to analyze resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and detect the neuronal interaction complexity underlying Parkinson's disease (PD) cognitive decline.
