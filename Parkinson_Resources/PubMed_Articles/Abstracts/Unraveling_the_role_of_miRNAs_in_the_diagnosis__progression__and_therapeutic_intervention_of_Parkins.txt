Title: Unraveling the role of miRNAs in the diagnosis, progression, and therapeutic intervention of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38081104

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurological disorder characterized by the impairment of the motor system, resulting in symptoms such as resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, difficulty with gait, and postural instability. The occurrence of striatal dopamine insufficiency can be attributed to a notable decline in dopaminergic neurons inside the substantia nigra pars compacta. Additionally, the development of Lewy bodies serves as a pathological hallmark of PD. While current therapy approaches for PD aim to preserve dopaminergic neurons or replenish dopamine levels in the brain, it is important to acknowledge that achieving complete remission of the condition remains elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miR) are a class of small, non-coding ribonucleic acids involved in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The miRNAs play a crucial part in the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of several neurodegenerative illnesses, including PD. The aim of this review is to explore the role of miRNAs in regulating genes associated with the onset and progression of PD, investigate the potential of miRNAs as a diagnostic tool, assess the effectiveness of targeting specific miRNAs as an alternative therapeutic strategy to impede disease advancement, and discuss the utilization of newly developed nanoparticles for delivering miRNAs as neurodegenerative therapies.
