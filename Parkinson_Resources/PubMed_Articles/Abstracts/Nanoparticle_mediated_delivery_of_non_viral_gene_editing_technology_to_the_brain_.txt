Title: Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of non-viral gene editing technology to the brain.
PMID: 38042249

Abstract:
Neurological disorders pose a significant burden on individuals and society, affecting millions worldwide. These disorders, including but not limited to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, often have limited treatment options and can lead to progressive degeneration and disability. Gene editing technologies, including Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFN), Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALEN), and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-associated Protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9), offer a promising avenue for potential cures by targeting and correcting the underlying genetic mutations responsible for neurologic disorders. However, efficient delivery methods are crucial for the successful application of gene editing technologies in the context of neurological disorders. The central nervous system presents unique challenges to treatment development due to the blood-brain barrier, which restricts the entry of large molecules. While viral vectors are traditionally used for gene delivery, nonviral delivery methods, such as nanoparticle-mediated delivery, offer safer alternatives that can efficiently transport gene editing components. Herein we aim to introduce the three main gene editing nucleases as nonviral treatments for neurologic disorders, the delivery barriers associated with brain targeting, and the current nonviral techniques used for brain-specific delivery. We highlight the challenges and opportunities for future research in this exciting and growing field that could lead to blood-brain barrier bypassing therapeutic gene editing.
