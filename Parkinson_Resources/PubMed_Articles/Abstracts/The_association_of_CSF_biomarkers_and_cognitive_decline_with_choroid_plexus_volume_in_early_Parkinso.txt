Title: The association of CSF biomarkers and cognitive decline with choroid plexus volume in early Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38183890

Abstract:
This study aims to determine the link between choroid plexus (CP) volume and cognitive decline in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) and to test whether pathological proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are involved in the modulation of any detrimental effects from CP volume.
