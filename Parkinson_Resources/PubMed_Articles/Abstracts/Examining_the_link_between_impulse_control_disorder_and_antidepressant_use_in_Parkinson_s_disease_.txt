Title: Examining the link between impulse control disorder and antidepressant use in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37922636

Abstract:
Impulse control disorders (ICD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) and hypomanic episodes of bipolar disorder show overlapping symptoms, suggesting a shared neurobiology. To explore this, the following hypotheses are tested: (1) larger changes in affective symptoms from OFF to ON medication states will be associated with ICD, (2) antidepressant exposure will be associated with larger OFF to ON affective symptom changes, and (3) antidepressant exposure will be associated with ICD.
