PMID: 37535549

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease which is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the United States is a serious and complex disease that may progress to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The early detection of the mild cognitive impairment and the identification of its biomarkers is crucial to support neurologists in monitoring the progression of the disease and allow an early initiation of effective therapeutic treatments that will improve the quality of life for the patients. In this paper, we propose the first deep-learning based approaches to detect mild cognitive impairment in the sleep Electroencephalography for patients with Parkinson's disease and further identify the discriminative features of the disease. The proposed frameworks start by segmenting the sleep Electroencephalography time series into three sleep stages (i.e., two non-rapid eye movement sleep-stages and one rapid eye movement sleep stage), further transforming the segmented signals in the time-frequency domain using the continuous wavelet transform and the variational mode decomposition and finally applying novel convolutional neural networks on the time-frequency representations. The gradient-weighted class activation mapping was also used to visualize the features based on which the proposed deep-learning approaches reached an accurate prediction of mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. The proposed variational mode decomposition-based model offered a superior accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under curve, and quadratic weighted Kappa score, all above 99% as compared with the continuous wavelet transform-based model (that achieved a performance that is almost above 92%) in differentiating mild cognitive impairment from normal cognition in sleep Electroencephalography for patients with Parkinson's disease. In addition, the features attributed to the mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease were demonstrated by changes in the middle and high frequency variational mode decomposition components across the three sleep-stages. The use of the proposed model on the time-frequency representation of the sleep Electroencephalography signals will provide a promising and precise computer-aided diagnostic tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment and hence, monitoring the progression of Parkinson's disease.
