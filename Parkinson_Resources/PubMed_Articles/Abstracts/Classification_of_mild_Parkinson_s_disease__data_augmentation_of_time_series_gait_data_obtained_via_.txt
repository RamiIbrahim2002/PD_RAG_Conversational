PMID: 37537260

Abstract:
Data-augmentation methods have emerged as a viable approach for improving the state-of-the-art performances for classifying mild Parkinson's disease using deep learning with time-series data from an inertial measurement unit, considering the limited amount of training datasets available in the medical field. This study investigated effective data-augmentation methods to classify mild Parkinson's disease and healthy participants with deep learning using a time-series gait dataset recorded via a shank-worn inertial measurement unit. Four magnitude-domain-transformation and three time-domain-transformation data-augmentation methods, and four methods involving mixtures of the aforementioned methods were applied to a representative convolutional neural network for the classification, and their performances were compared. In terms of data-augmentation, compared with baseline classification accuracy without data-augmentation, the magnitude-domain transformation performed better than the time-domain transformation and mixed-data augmentation. In the magnitude-domain transformation, the rotation method significantly contributed to the best performance improvement, yielding accuracy and F1-score improvements of 5.5 and 5.9%, respectively. The augmented data could be varied while maintaining the features of the time-series data obtained via the sensor for detecting mild Parkinson's in gait; this data attribute may have caused the aforementioned trend. Notably, the selection of appropriate data extensions will help improve the classification performance for mild Parkinson's disease.
