Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The treatment of PD aims to alleviate motor symptoms by replacing the reduced endogenous dopamine. Currently, there are no disease-modifying agents for the treatment of PD. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have emerged as an effective tool for new drug discovery and screening in the age of translational research. The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is known to cause a similar loss of dopaminergic neurons in the human midbrain, with corresponding Parkinsonian symptoms. L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) have been implicated in the generation of mitochondrial oxidative stress, which underlies the pathogenesis of PD. Therefore, we investigated the neuro-restorative effect of LTCC inhibition in an MPTP-induced zebrafish PD model and suggested a possible drug candidate that might modify the progression of PD.
