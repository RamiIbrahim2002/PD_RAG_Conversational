PMID: 38007248

Abstract:
Ketogenic therapies have shown benefit for seizure reduction in epilepsy but their impact on other neurologic conditions is less known. In this literature review, the efficacy of ketogenic therapies were assessed in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
