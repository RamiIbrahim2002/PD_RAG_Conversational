Title: <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> Efficacy in the Treatment of Drug-Induced Parkinsonism: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PMID: 38116567

Abstract:
Drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is one of the most common movement disorders in approximately 20 - 35% of patients on antipsychotic medications. Managing the symptoms of DIP is challenging due to the limited number of potentially effective medications. On the other hand, this restricted possible treatment could have numerous side effects that ultimately result in patients stopping the medication all at once. The neuroprotective property of <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> extract (EGb) emerged as an effective commodity for the additional treatment of psychiatric disorders.
