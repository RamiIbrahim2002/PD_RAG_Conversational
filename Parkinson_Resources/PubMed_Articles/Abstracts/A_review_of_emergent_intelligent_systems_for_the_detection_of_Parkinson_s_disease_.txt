Title: A review of emergent intelligent systems for the detection of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37872986

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting people worldwide. The PD symptoms are divided into motor and non-motor symptoms. Detection of PD is very crucial and essential. Such challenges can be overcome by applying artificial intelligence to diagnose PD. Many studies have also proposed the implementation of computer-aided diagnosis for the detection of PD. This systematic review comprehensively analyzed all appropriate algorithms for detecting and assessing PD based on the literature from 2012 to 2023 which are conducted as per PRISMA model. This review focused on motor symptoms, namely handwriting dynamics, voice impairments and gait, multimodal features, and brain observation using single photon emission computed tomography, magnetic resonance and electroencephalogram signals. The significant challenges are critically analyzed, and appropriate recommendations are provided. The critical discussion of this review article can be helpful in today's PD community in such a way that it allows clinicians to provide proper treatment and timely medication.
