Title: My History in Juntendo University.
PMID: 38855067

Abstract:
With my retirement as a professor, I would like to review my 47-year history of studying and working at Juntendo University. I was admitted to Juntendo University School of Medicine in 1976, and after graduation I joined the Department of Neurology in 1982, where Professor Hirotaro Narabayashi was the founding chairman. I became particularly interested in movement disorders and neurophysiology. The second chairman, Professor Yoshikuni Mizuno, established an American-style neurology training system. From 1992 to 1994, I studied electrophysiology at the University of Calgary in Canada, and my family and I enjoyed life in Canada very much. In 2000, I moved to Juntendo Izu-Nagaoka Hospital, now renamed Juntendo Shizuoka Hospital. I instructed young neurologists to write case reports in English. Owing to this achievement, the third chairman, Professor Nobutaka Hattori, recommended me to be a recipient of Alumni Scientific Award and to become a professor of neurology in 2009. I also became an executive officer of the Asian and Oceanian Section of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society from 2015 to 2019. In 2017, I was appointed as the dean of the Faculty of Health Science and Nursing. I devoted myself to improving the nursing education and then I received the Best Professor Award twice. The level of the faculty improved, so that all the students were able to pass the National Nursing Examination consistently. In conclusion, I thank all my colleagues, faculty members, and family for letting me have valuable experiences and memories in Juntendo University.
