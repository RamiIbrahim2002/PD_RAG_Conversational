PMID: 37559448

Abstract:
Levodopa combined with traditional Chinese medicine has a synergistic effect on Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, we demonstrated that <i>Nardostachys jatamansi</i> (D. Don) DC. [syn. <i>Patrinia jatamansi</i> D.Don, <i>N. grandiflora</i> DC.] (Valerianaceae) (NJ) can alleviate PD.
