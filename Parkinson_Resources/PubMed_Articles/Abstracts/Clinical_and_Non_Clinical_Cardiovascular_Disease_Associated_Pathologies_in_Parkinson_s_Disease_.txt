Title: Clinical and Non-Clinical Cardiovascular Disease Associated Pathologies in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37628780

Abstract:
Despite considerable breakthroughs in Parkinson's disease (PD) research, understanding of non-motor symptoms (NMS) in PD remains limited. The lack of basic level models that can properly recapitulate PD NMS either in vivo or in vitro complicates matters. Even so, recent research advances have identified cardiovascular NMS as being underestimated in PD. Considering that a cardiovascular phenotype reflects sympathetic autonomic dysregulation, cardiovascular symptoms of PD can play a pivotal role in understanding the pathogenesis of PD. In this study, we have reviewed clinical and non-clinical published papers with four key parameters: cardiovascular disease risks, electrocardiograms (ECG), neurocardiac lesions in PD, and fundamental electrophysiological studies that can be linked to the heart. We have highlighted the points and limitations that the reviewed articles have in common. ECG and pathological reports suggested that PD patients may undergo alterations in neurocardiac regulation. The pathological evidence also suggested that the hearts of PD patients were involved in alpha-synucleinopathy. Finally, there is to date little research available that addresses the electrophysiology of in vitro Parkinson's disease models. For future reference, research that can integrate cardiac electrophysiology and pathological alterations is required.
