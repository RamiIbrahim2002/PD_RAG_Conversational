PMID: 38026513

Abstract:
The apolipoprotein E (<i>APOE</i>) ε4 allele has been associated with cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD), but little is known about its relationship with motor and other nonmotor symptoms and whether <i>APOE</i> ε4 retains an influence on cognition when other factors are considered.
