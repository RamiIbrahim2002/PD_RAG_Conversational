Title: Correlation of olfactory function factors with cardiac sympathetic denervation in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37940708

Abstract:
Hyposmia is a common nonmotor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and reportedly associated with dysautonomia in PD. The smell identification test for measuring olfactory function consists of multiple items to discriminate specific scents. In the present study, factor analysis of the smell identification test was performed, and the correlation of extracted factors with cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) in patients with PD was investigated.
