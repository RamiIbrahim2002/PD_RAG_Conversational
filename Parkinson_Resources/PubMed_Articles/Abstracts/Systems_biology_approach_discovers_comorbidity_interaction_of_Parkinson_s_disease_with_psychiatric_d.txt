Title: Systems biology approach discovers comorbidity interaction of Parkinson's disease with psychiatric disorders utilizing brain transcriptome.
PMID: 37654790

Abstract:
Several studies found that most patients with Parkinson's disorder (PD) appear to have psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hallucination, delusion, and cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, recognizing these psychiatrically symptoms of PD patients is crucial for both symptomatic therapy and better knowledge of the pathophysiology of PD. In order to address this issue, we created a bioinformatics framework to determine the effects of PD mRNA expression on understanding its relationship with psychiatric symptoms in PD patients. We have discovered a significant overlap between the sets of differentially expressed genes from PD exposed tissue and psychiatric disordered tissues using RNA-seq datasets. We have chosen Bipolar disorder and Schizophrenia as psychiatric disorders in our study. A number of significant correlations between PD and the occurrence of psychiatric diseases were also found by gene set enrichment analysis, investigations of the protein-protein interaction network, gene regulatory network, and protein-chemical agent interaction network. We anticipate that the results of this pathogenetic study will provide crucial information for understanding the intricate relationship between PD and psychiatric diseases.
