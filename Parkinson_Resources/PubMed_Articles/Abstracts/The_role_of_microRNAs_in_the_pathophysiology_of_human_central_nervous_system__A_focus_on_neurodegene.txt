Title: The role of microRNAs in the pathophysiology of human central nervous system: A focus on neurodegenerative diseases.
PMID: 37832609

Abstract:
microRNAs (miRNAs) are suggested to play substantial roles in regulating the development and various physiologic functions of the central nervous system (CNS). These include neurogenesis, cell fate and differentiation, morphogenesis, formation of dendrites, and targeting non-neural mRNAs. Notably, deregulation of an increasing number of miRNAs is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and CNS tumors. They are particularly known to affect the amyloid β (Aβ) cleavage and accumulation, tau protein homeostasis, and expression of alpha-synuclein (α-syn), Parkin, PINK1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. These include miR-16, miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-106a, miR-106b, miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-103, miR-107, miR-298, miR-328, miR-195, miR-485, and miR-29. In CNS tumors, several miRNAs, including miR-31, miR-16, and miR-21 have been identified to modulate tumorigenesis through impacting tumor invasion and apoptosis. In this review article, we have a look at the recent advances on our knowledge about the role of miRNAs in human brain development and functions, neurodegenerative diseases, and their clinical potentials.
