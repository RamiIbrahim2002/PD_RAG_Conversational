Title: Cystathionine β-Synthase Suppresses NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation <i>via</i> Redox Regulation in Microglia.
PMID: 37464816

Abstract:
<b><i>Aims:</i></b> Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) is essential for homocysteine (Hcy) transsulfuration, yielding cysteine as a common precursor of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), glutathione (GSH), and other sulfur molecules, which produce neuroprotective effects in neurological conditions. We previously reported a disruption of microglial CBS/H<sub>2</sub>S signaling in a Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model. Yet, it remains unclear whether CBS affects nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activity and other pathologies in PD. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Microglial CBS expression decreased after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Elevated GSSG (the oxidized GSH) content and decreased H<sub>2</sub>S generation were found in the brains of microglial <i>cbs</i> conditional-knockout (<i>cbs</i><sup>cKO</sup>) mice, whereas serum and brain Hcy levels remained unaltered. Moreover, microglial <i>cbs</i><sup>cKO</sup> mice were susceptible to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and dopaminergic neuron losses caused by LPS injection into the substantia nigra, whereas <i>cbs</i> overexpression or activation produced opposite effects. <i>In vitro</i> studies showed that <i>cbs</i> overexpression or activation suppressed microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation and interleukin (IL)-1β secretion by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS) level. Conversely, ablation of <i>cbs</i> enhanced NLRP3 expression and mitoROS generation and augmented microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activity in response to adenosine triphosphate challenge, which was blocked by the mitoROS scavenger. <b><i>Innovation and Conclusion:</i></b> The study demonstrated an elevated GSSG level and reduced H<sub>2</sub>S generation, which correlated with a susceptible status of microglia in the brain of <i>cbs</i><sup>cKO</sup> mice. Our findings reveal a critical role of CBS in restraining the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome by controlling redox homeostasis and highlight that activation or upregulation of CBS may become a potential strategy for PD treatment.
