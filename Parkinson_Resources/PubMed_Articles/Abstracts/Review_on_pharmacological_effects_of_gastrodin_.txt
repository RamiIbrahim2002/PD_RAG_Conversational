PMID: 37749449

Abstract:
Gastrodia elata Blume is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine that is mainly used to treat diseases related to the nervous system, such as stroke, epilepsy, and headache. Gastrodin is the main bioactive component of Gastrodia elata Blume, and studies have shown that it has extensive pharmacological activity. This narrative review aims to systematically review relevant studies on the pharmacological effects of gastrodin to provide researchers with the latest and most useful information. Studies have shown that gastrodin has prominent neuroprotective effects and can treat or improve epilepsy, Tourette syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, emotional disorders, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, cognitive impairment, and neuropathic pain. Gastrodin can also improve myocardial hypertrophy, hypertension, and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. In addition, gastrodin can mitigate liver, kidney, and bone tissue damage caused by oxidative stress and inflammation. In short, gastrodin is expected to treat many diseases, and it is worth investing more effort in research on this compound.
