Title: Striatal and thalamic automatic segmentation, morphology, and clinical correlates in Parkinsonism: Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy.
PMID: 37806261

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD), multisystem atrophy (MSA), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) present similarly with bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and cognitive impairments. Neuroimaging studies have found differential changes in the nigrostriatal pathway in these disorders, however whether the volume and shape of specific regions within this pathway can distinguish between atypical Parkinsonian disorders remains to be determined. This paper investigates striatal and thalamic volume and morphology as distinguishing biomarkers, and their relationship to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Automatic segmentation to calculate volume and shape analysis of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and thalamus were performed in 18 PD patients, 12 MSA, 15 PSP, and 20 healthy controls, then correlated with clinical measures. PSP bilateral thalami and right putamen were significantly smaller than controls, but not MSA or PD. The left caudate and putamen significantly correlated with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory total score. Bilateral thalamus, caudate, and left putamen had significantly different morphology between groups, driven by differences between PSP and healthy controls. This study demonstrated that PSP patient striatal and thalamic volume and shape are significantly different when compared with controls. Parkinsonian disorders could not be differentiated on volumetry or morphology, however there are trends for volumetric and morphological changes associated with PD, MSA, and PSP.
