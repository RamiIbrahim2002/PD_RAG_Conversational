Title: Pinostrobin mitigates neurodegeneration through an up-regulation of antioxidants and GDNF in a rat model of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38434672

Abstract:
<b>Background</b>: One of the most common neurodegenerative diseases is Parkinson's disease (PD); PD is characterized by a reduction of neurons containing dopamine in the substantia nigra (SN), which leads to a lack of dopamine (DA) in nigrostriatal pathways, resulting in motor function disorders. Oxidative stress is considered as one of the etiologies involved in dopaminergic neuronal loss. Thus, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of pinostrobin (PB), a bioflavonoid extracted from <i>Boesenbergia rotunda</i> with antioxidative activity in PD. <b>Methods</b>: Rats were treated with 40 mg/kg of PB for seven consecutive days before and after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD. After completing the experiment, the brains including SN and striatum were used for histological studies and biochemical assays. <b>Results</b>: PB treatment demonstrated a reduction of free radicals in the SN as indicated by significantly decreased MDA levels, whereas the antioxidative enzymes (SOD and GSH) were significantly increased. Furthermore, PB treatment significantly increased glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) immunolabelling which has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on the survival of dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, PB treatment was shown to protect CA1 and CA3 neurons in the hippocampus and dopaminergic neurons in the SN. DA levels in the SN were increased after PB treatment, leading to the improvement of motor function of PD rats. <b>Conclusions</b>: These results imply that PB prevents MPTP-induced neurotoxicity via its antioxidant activities and increases GDNF levels, which may contribute to the therapeutic strategy for PD.
