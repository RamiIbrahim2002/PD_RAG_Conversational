Title: Exploring the potential of vagus nerve stimulation in treating brain diseases: a review of immunologic benefits and neuroprotective efficacy.
PMID: 37853458

Abstract:
The vagus nerve serves as a critical connection between the central nervous system and internal organs. Originally known for its effectiveness in treating refractory epilepsy, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has shown potential for managing other brain diseases, including ischaemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. However, the precise mechanisms of VNS and its benefits for brain diseases are not yet fully understood. Recent studies have found that VNS can inhibit inflammation, promote neuroprotection, help maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, have multisystemic modulatory effects, and even transmit signals from the gut flora to the brain. In this article, we will review several essential studies that summarize the current theories of VNS and its immunomodulatory effects, as well as the therapeutic value of VNS for brain disorders. By doing so, we aim to provide a better understanding of how the neuroimmune network operates and inspire future research in this field.
