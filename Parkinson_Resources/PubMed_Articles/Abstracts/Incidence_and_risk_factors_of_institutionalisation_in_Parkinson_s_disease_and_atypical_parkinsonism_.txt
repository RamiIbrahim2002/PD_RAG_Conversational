Title: Incidence and risk factors of institutionalisation in Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism.
PMID: 37980851

Abstract:
The basic epidemiology of institutionalisation (the need for long-term care in an institution) in parkinsonism is unclear. We aimed to identify the incidence of, and risk factors for, institutionalisation in Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonism (AP).
