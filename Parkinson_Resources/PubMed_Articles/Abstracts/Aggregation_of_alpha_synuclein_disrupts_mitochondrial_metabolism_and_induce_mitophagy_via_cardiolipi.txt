Title: Aggregation of alpha-synuclein disrupts mitochondrial metabolism and induce mitophagy via cardiolipin externalization.

Abstract:
Accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates in the substantia nigra pars compacta is central in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, leading to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and the manifestation of motor symptoms. Although several PD models mimic the pathological accumulation of α-synuclein after overexpression, they do not allow for controlling and monitoring its aggregation. We recently generated a new optogenetic tool by which we can spatiotemporally control the aggregation of α-synuclein using a light-induced protein aggregation system. Using this innovative tool, we aimed to characterize the impact of α-synuclein clustering on mitochondria, whose activity is crucial to maintain neuronal survival. We observed that aggregates of α-synuclein transiently and dynamically interact with mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial depolarization, lower ATP production, mitochondrial fragmentation and degradation via cardiolipin externalization-dependent mitophagy. Aggregation of α-synuclein also leads to lower mitochondrial content in human dopaminergic neurons and in mouse midbrain. Interestingly, overexpression of α-synuclein alone did not induce mitochondrial degradation. This work is among the first to clearly discriminate between the impact of α-synuclein overexpression and aggregation on mitochondria. This study thus represents a new framework to characterize the role of mitochondria in PD.
