Title: Monitoring the Effect of Levodopa Using Sustained Phonemes in Parkinson's Disease Patients.
PMID: 38083746

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disease identified by multiple symptoms, and levodopa is one of the most effective medications for treating the disease. To determine the dosage of levodopa, it is necessary to meet on a regular basis and observe motor function. The early detection and progression of the disease have been proposed using hypokinetic dysarthria. However, previous studies have not examined the effects of levodopa on speech rigorously and have provided inconsistent results. In this study, three sustained phonemes of PD patients were investigated for the effect of medication. A set of features characterizing vocal fold dynamics as well as the vocal tract coordinators were extracted from the sustained phonemes /of 28 PD patients during levodopa medication off and on states. All the features were statistically investigated and classified using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. LDA classifier identified medication on from medication off based on the combined features from phoneme /a/, /o/ and /m/ with the accuracy=82.75% and F1-score=82.18%. Voice recording of PD patients during sustained phonemes /a/, /o/ and /m/ has the potential for identifying whether the patients are in On state or Off state of medication.Clinical Relevance- The outcomes of this study have the potential to monitor the effect and progress of levodopa on PD patients.
