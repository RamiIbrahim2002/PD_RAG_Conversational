Title: Home-based exercise training by using a smartphone app in patients with Parkinson's disease: a feasibility study.
PMID: 37448748

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) patients experience deterioration in mobility with consequent inactivity and worsened health and social status. Physical activity and physiotherapy can improve motor impairments, but several barriers dishearten PD patients to exercise regularly. Home-based approaches (e.g., via mobile apps) and remote monitoring, could help in facing this issue.
