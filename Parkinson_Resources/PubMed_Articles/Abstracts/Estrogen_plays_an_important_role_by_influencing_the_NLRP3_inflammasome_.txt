Title: Estrogen plays an important role by influencing the NLRP3 inflammasome.
PMID: 37738797

Abstract:
The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is an important part of the natural immune system that plays an important role in many diseases. Estrogen is a sex hormone that plays an important role in controlling reproduction and regulates many physiological and pathological processes. Recent studies have indicated that estrogen is associated with disease progression. Estrogen can ameliorate some diseases (e. g, sepsis, mood disturbances, cerebral ischemia, some hepatopathy, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, osteoarthritis, and renal fibrosis) by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome. Estrogen can also promote the development of diseases (e.g., ovarian endometriosis, dry eye disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus) by upregulating the NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, estrogen has a dual effect on the development of cancers and asthma. However, the mechanism of these effects is not summarized. This article reviewed the progress in understanding the effects of estrogen on the NLRP3 inflammasome and its mechanisms in recent years to provide a theoretical basis for an in-depth study.
