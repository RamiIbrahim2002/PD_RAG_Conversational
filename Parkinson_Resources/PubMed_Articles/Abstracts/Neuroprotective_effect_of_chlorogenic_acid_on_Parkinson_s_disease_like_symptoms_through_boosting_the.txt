Title: Neuroprotective effect of chlorogenic acid on Parkinson's disease like symptoms through boosting the autophagy in zebrafish.
PMID: 37544423

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms, including hypokinesia, postural instability, dopaminergic (DA) neurons loss, and α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation. A growing number of patients show negative responses towards the current therapies. Thus, preventative or disease-modifying treatment agents are worth to further research. In recent years, compounds extracted from natural sources become promising candidates to treat PD. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a phenolic compound appearing in coffee, honeysuckle, and eucommia that showed their potential as antioxidants and neuroprotectors. In this study, we investigated the anti-PD activity of CGA by testing its effect on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) zebrafish model of PD. It was shown that CGA relieved MPTP-induced PD-like symptoms including DA neurons and blood vessel loss, locomotion reduction, and apoptosis events in brain. Moreover, CGA modulated the expression of PD- and autophagy-related genes (α-syn, lc3b, p62, atg5, atg7, and ulk1b), showing its ability to promote the autophagy which was interrupted in the PD pathology. The unblocked effect of CGA on autophagy was further verified in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-modeled SHSY5Y cells. Our findings indicated that CGA might relieve PD by boosting the autophagy in neuronal cells that makes CGA a potential candidate for anti-PD treatment.
