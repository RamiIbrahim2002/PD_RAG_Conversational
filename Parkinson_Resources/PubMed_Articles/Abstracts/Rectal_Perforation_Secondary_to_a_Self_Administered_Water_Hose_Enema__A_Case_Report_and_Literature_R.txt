PMID: 37605687

Abstract:
Chronic functional constipation is a common condition that can have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life and healthcare costs. Hydrostatic enemas are a commonly observed practice among patients with chronic constipation. Rectal perforation is a rare yet serious complication that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Here, we present the case of an elderly lady with Parkinson's disease who presented with upper rectal perforation after using a hydrostatic enema and was treated with Hartmann's procedure. This case highlights the importance of having a low threshold for suspecting and diagnosing colorectal perforation in patients presenting with abdominal pain after receiving a hydrostatic enema.
