Title: α-Synuclein-dependent increases in PIP5K1γ drive inositol signaling to promote neurotoxicity.
PMID: 37838947

Abstract:
Anomalous aggregation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) is a pathological hallmark of many degenerative synucleinopathies including Lewy body dementia (LBD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite its strong link to disease, the precise molecular mechanisms that link α-Syn aggregation to neurodegeneration have yet to be elucidated. Here, we find that elevated α-Syn leads to an increase in the plasma membrane (PM) phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, which precipitates α-Syn aggregation and drives toxic increases in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reactive oxygen species leading to neuronal death. Upstream of this toxic signaling pathway is PIP5K1γ, whose abundance and localization is enhanced at the PM by α-Syn-dependent increases in ARF6. Selective inhibition of PIP5K1γ or knockout of ARF6 in neurons rescues α-Syn aggregation and cellular phenotypes of toxicity. Collectively, our data suggest that modulation of phosphoinositide metabolism may be a therapeutic target to slow neurodegeneration for PD and other related neurodegenerative disorders.
