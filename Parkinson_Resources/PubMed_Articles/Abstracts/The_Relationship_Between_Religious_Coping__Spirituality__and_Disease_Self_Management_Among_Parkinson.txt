PMID: 37985590

Abstract:
Religion and spirituality can be important motivational tools in the management of Parkinson's disease. This study was conducted to determine the relationship between religious coping methods, spirituality, and disease self-management levels in Parkinson's patients. This descriptive, cross-sectional, and correlational study was conducted with 294 Parkinson's patients. Descriptive statistics, independent samples t test, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson correlation coefficient, and structural equation modeling were used in the analysis of the data. This study showed that Parkinson's patients adopted both positive and negative religious coping styles, demonstrated good levels of spirituality, and had high levels of disease self-management. A statistically significant relationship was found between the positive and negative religious coping levels of Parkinson's patients and their levels of spirituality and disease self-management (p < 0.05). Health professionals may consider and support Parkinson's patients' use of religion as a coping mechanism, as this may help manage Parkinson's disease.
