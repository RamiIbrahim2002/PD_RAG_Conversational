Title: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study comparing tremor-dominant and postural instability/gait difficulty subtypes of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37474664

Abstract:
The symptom-specific intrinsic neural mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease (PD) subtypes (tremor dominant [TD] and postural instability gait difficulty [PIGD]) remain unclarified. We examined spontaneous brain activity patterns in TD and PIGD.
