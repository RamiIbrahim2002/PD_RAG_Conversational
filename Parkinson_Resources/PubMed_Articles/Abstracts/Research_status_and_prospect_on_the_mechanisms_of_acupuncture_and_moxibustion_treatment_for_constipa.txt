PMID: 37879957

Abstract:
Constipation may accelerate the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). The quality of life in PD patients can be significantly improved when constipation is treated, hence the disease progression may be delayed. At present, the mechanism research is still at the initial stage for acupuncture in treatment of PD, focusing on neurohumoral factors, intestinal flora, bacterial fermentation products and intestinal inflammationï¼› and there are the problems such as single intervention, thinking limitation and insufficient cooperation among disciplines. This paper systematically reviews the mechanism research progress of acupuncture for the treatment of constipation in PD so as to provide the references for the subsequent studies.
