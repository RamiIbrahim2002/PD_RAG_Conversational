Title: Safety perception in patients with advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease - a qualitative study.
PMID: 37744397

Abstract:
A fundamental cornerstone of quality of healthcare is patient safety, which many people with life-limiting illnesses feel is being compromised. Perceptions of impaired safety are associated with the occurrence of psychological distress and healthcare utilization. However, little is known about how people with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) perceive their own safety toward the end of life. The aim of our study was therefore to investigate factors that influence the perception of safety of patients with advanced iPD.
