Title: The Impact of Vitamin D on Neuropsychiatric Disorders.
PMID: 38022259

Abstract:
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that has multiple biological effects on the body. Recent findings have also linked vitamin D deficiency to a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. The aim of this review article is to provide insight into the metabolism of vitamin D and its effect on the body, especially on the brain, and to recognize the role of vitamin D in some neuropsychiatric disorders. Vitamin D is well-known as a neuroactive steroid that modulates brain functions and development. There is strong evidence to show that optimal vitamin D levels are important to protect against neuropsychiatric disorders. Vitamin D has also been proposed to alter neurotransmitter pathways in the central nervous system. Abnormalities in these neurotransmitters have been implicated in various neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Vitamin D also has some reported neurosteroid-like actions, including regulation of calcium homeostasis, clearance of amyloid-peptide, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as possible protection against the neurodegenerative mechanisms associated with Alzheimer's disease and autism. Vitamin D is an important modulator of brain development and has many functions in the brain. Several studies found that vitamin D has a protective role in neuropsychiatric disorders, and its supplementation decreases the development of these disorders and lowers their symptoms. Therefore, evidence shows that early intervention to maintain vitamin D concentrations at sufficiently high levels is crucial to slow, prevent, or improve neurocognitive decline.
