Title: Overall comorbidities in functional neurological disorder: A narrative review.
PMID: 37414721

Abstract:
The importance to assess and include the frequent comorbidities in the personalised care management plan of patients with functional neurological disorders (FND) has arisen through the years. FND patients are not only complaining from motor and/or sensory symptoms. They also report some non-specific symptoms that participate to the burden of FND. In this narrative review, we aim to better describe these comorbidities in terms of prevalence, clinical characteristics and their variability depending on the subtype of FND.
