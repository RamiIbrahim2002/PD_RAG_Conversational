Title: Gastrointestinal microbiome and cholelithiasis: Prospect in the nervous system.
PMID: 37753368

Abstract:
Dan and colleagues recently published research suggesting that the gastrointestinal microbiome (microorganisms and metabolites) in cholelithiasis. They reviewed gallbladder stones, choledocholithiasis, and asymptomatic gallstones. Finally, their discussion was on the gastrointestinal. We focused on complementing the effect of the S1 protein and neuroinflammatory changes caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Our contribution was about to involve the microbiota and the nervous system. They can have similar functions because they have similar pathways and advantages, bearing in mind Î³-aminobutyric acid in schizophrenia and serotonin in Parkinson's disease. Therefore in the next few years, more research should be encouraged on the microbiota consequences for development, and mobility.
