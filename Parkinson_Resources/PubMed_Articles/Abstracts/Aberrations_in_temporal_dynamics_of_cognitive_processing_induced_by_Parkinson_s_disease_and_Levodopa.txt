Title: Aberrations in temporal dynamics of cognitive processing induced by Parkinson's disease and Levodopa.
PMID: 37980451

Abstract:
The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been shown to significantly improve by Levodopa. However, despite the widespread adoption of Levodopa as a standard pharmaceutical drug for the treatment of PD, cognitive impairments linked to PD do not show visible improvement with Levodopa treatment. Furthermore, the neuronal and network mechanisms behind the PD-induced cognitive impairments are not clearly understood. In this work, we aim to explain these cognitive impairments, as well as the ones exacerbated by Levodopa, through examining the differential dynamic patterns of the phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) during cognitive functions. EEG data recorded in an auditory oddball task performed by a cohort consisting of controls and a group of PD patients during both on and off periods of Levodopa treatment were analyzed to derive the temporal dynamics of the PAC across the brain. We observed distinguishing patterns in the PAC dynamics, as an indicator of information binding, which can explain the slower cognitive processing associated with PD in the form of a latency in the PAC peak time. Thus, considering the high-level connections between the hippocampus, the posterior and prefrontal cortices established through the dorsal and ventral striatum acting as a modulatory system, we posit that the primary issue with cognitive impairments of PD, as well as Levodopa's cognitive deficit side effects, can be attributed to the changes in temporal dynamics of dopamine release influencing the modulatory function of the striatum.
