Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common chronic, age-related neurodegenerative disease. This disease is characterized by a long prodromal period. In this context, it is important to search for the genes and mechanisms that are involved in the development of the pathological process in the earliest stages of the disease. Published data suggest that blood cells, particularly lymphocytes, may be a model for studying the processes that occur in the brain in PD. Thus, in the present work, we performed an analysis of changes in the expression of the genes <i>ADORA2A</i>, <i>MTA1</i>, <i>PTGDS</i>, <i>PTGS2</i>, <i>NSF</i>, and <i>HNMT</i> in the peripheral blood of patients with early stages of PD (stages 1 and 2 of the Hoehn-Yahr scale). We found significant and PD-specific expression changes of four genes, i.e., <i>MTA1</i>, <i>PTGS2</i>, <i>NSF</i>, and <i>HNMT</i>, in the peripheral blood of patients with early stages of PD. These genes may be associated with PD pathogenesis in the early clinical stages and can be considered as potential candidate genes for this disease. Altered expression of the <i>ADORA2A</i> gene in treated PD patients may indicate that this gene is involved in processes affected by antiparkinsonian therapy.
