Title: Evaluation of Long Non-coding RNA Expression Profiles in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells of Patients with Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37436601

Abstract:
As in many biological processes, the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are currently known to have important roles in Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of the study is to evaluate differentiated expressions of lncRNAs and their target mRNAs in the peripheral blood cells of individuals with Parkinson's disease. The peripheral blood samples were taken from 10 Parkinson's diagnosed people aging 50 years and more and from 10 healthy people as for the control group. Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and a total of 5 samples were selected and evaluated by microarray analysis. lncRNAs with high fold change (fc < 1.5/fc > 1.5) were determined as a result of the analysis. Following this, the expression changes of some lncRNAs and their target mRNAs were examined by quantitative simultaneous polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in all individuals in the patient and control groups. Also, in order to determine the molecular level basic activities of lncRNAs determined by microarray analysis and which biological process and biochemical pathway they were in, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis ( http://geneontology.org/ ) database was used. Thirteen upregulated and 31 downregulated lncRNAs whose expression changes were determined by microarray analysis and confirmed by qRT-PCR method were found in Parkinson's patients. As they were evaluated by GO analysis, lncRNAs were expressed differently in patient and control groups and they are found to be related with the processes such as macromolecule metabolic processes, immune system, gene expression, cell activation, ATPase activity, DNA packaging complex, signal receptor activity, immune receptor activity, and protein binding were found to be significant.
