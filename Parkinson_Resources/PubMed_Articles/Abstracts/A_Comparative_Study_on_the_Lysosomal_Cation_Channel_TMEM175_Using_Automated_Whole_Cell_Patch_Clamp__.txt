PMID: 37628970

Abstract:
The lysosomal cation channel TMEM175 is a Parkinson's disease-related protein and a promising drug target. Unlike whole-cell automated patch-clamp (APC), lysosomal patch-clamp (LPC) facilitates physiological conditions, but is not yet suitable for high-throughput screening (HTS) applications. Here, we apply solid supported membrane-based electrophysiology (SSME), which enables both direct access to lysosomes and high-throughput electrophysiological recordings. In SSME, ion translocation mediated by TMEM175 is stimulated using a concentration gradient at a resting potential of 0 mV. The concentration-dependent K<sup>+</sup> response exhibited an I/c curve with two distinct slopes, indicating the existence of two conducting states. We measured H<sup>+</sup> fluxes with a permeability ratio of P<sub>H</sub>/P<sub>K</sub> = 48,500, which matches literature findings from patch-clamp studies, validating the SSME approach. Additionally, TMEM175 displayed a high pH dependence. Decreasing cytosolic pH inhibited both K<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> conductivity of TMEM175. Conversely, lysosomal pH and pH gradients did not have major effects on TMEM175. Finally, we developed HTS assays for drug screening and evaluated tool compounds (4-AP, Zn as inhibitors; DCPIB, arachidonic acid, SC-79 as enhancers) using SSME and APC. Additionally, we recorded EC<sub>50</sub> data for eight blinded TMEM175 enhancers and compared the results across all three assay technologies, including LPC, discussing their advantages and disadvantages.
