Title: Predictors of Burden in Carers of Patients with Impulse Control Behaviors in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37772283

Abstract:
Impulse control behaviors (ICBs) are problematic, reward-based behaviors, affecting 15% to 35% of patients with Parkinson's disease. Evidence exists of increased carer burden as a result of these behaviors; however, little is known about the variables mediating this effect and their management.
