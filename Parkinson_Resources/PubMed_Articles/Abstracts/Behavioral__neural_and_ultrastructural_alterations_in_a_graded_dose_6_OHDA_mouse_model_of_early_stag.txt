Title: Behavioral, neural and ultrastructural alterations in a graded-dose 6-OHDA mouse model of early-stage Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37945922

Abstract:
Studying animal models furthers our understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology by providing tools to investigate detailed molecular, cellular and circuit functions. Different versions of the neurotoxin-based 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD have been widely used in rats. However, these models typically assess the result of extensive and definitive dopaminergic lesions that reflect a late stage of PD, leading to a paucity of studies and a consequential gap of knowledge regarding initial stages, in which early interventions would be possible. Additionally, the better availability of genetic tools increasingly shifts the focus of research from rats to mice, but few mouse PD models are available yet. To address these, we characterize here the behavioral, neuronal and ultrastructural features of a graded-dose unilateral, single-injection, striatal 6-OHDA model in mice, focusing on early-stage changes within the first two weeks of lesion induction. We observed early onset, dose-dependent impairments of overall locomotion without substantial deterioration of motor coordination. In accordance, histological evaluation demonstrated a partial, dose-dependent loss of dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Furthermore, electron microscopic analysis revealed degenerative ultrastructural changes in SNc dopaminergic neurons. Our results show that mild ultrastructural and cellular degradation of dopaminergic neurons of the SNc can lead to certain motor deficits shortly after unilateral striatal lesions, suggesting that a unilateral dose-dependent intrastriatal 6-OHDA lesion protocol can serve as a successful model of the early stages of Parkinson's disease in mice.
