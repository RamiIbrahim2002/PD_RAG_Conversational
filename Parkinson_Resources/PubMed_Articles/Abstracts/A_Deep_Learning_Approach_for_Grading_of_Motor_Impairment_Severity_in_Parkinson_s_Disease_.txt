Title: A Deep Learning Approach for Grading of Motor Impairment Severity in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 38083387

Abstract:
Objective and quantitative monitoring of movement impairments is crucial for detecting progression in neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease (PD). This study examined the ability of deep learning approaches to grade motor impairment severity in a modified version of the Movement Disorders Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) using low-cost wearable sensors. A convolutional neural network architecture, XceptionTime, was used to classify lower and higher levels of motor impairment in persons with PD, across five distinct rhythmic tasks: finger tapping, hand movements, pronation-supination movements of the hands, toe tapping, and leg agility. In addition, an aggregate model was trained on data from all tasks together for evaluating bradykinesia symptom severity in PD. The model performance was highest in the hand movement tasks with an accuracy of 82.6% in the hold-out test dataset; the accuracy for the aggregate model was 79.7%, however, it demonstrated the lowest variability. Overall, these findings suggest the feasibility of integrating low-cost wearable technology and deep learning approaches to automatically and objectively quantify motor impairment in persons with PD. This approach may provide a viable solution for a widely deployable telemedicine solution.
