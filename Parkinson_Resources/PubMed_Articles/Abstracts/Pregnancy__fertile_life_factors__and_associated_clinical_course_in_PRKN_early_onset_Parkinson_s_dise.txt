PMID: 37658959

Abstract:
As the most common cause of autosomal recessive early onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD), parkin type Parkinson's disease (PRKN-PD) may affect female patients in childbearing age. Accordingly, issues related to fertility must be adequately addressed. Here, we landscaped fertile life factors and pregnancy course of a PRKN-PD cohort, including both novel cases directly observed at our center and published ones.
