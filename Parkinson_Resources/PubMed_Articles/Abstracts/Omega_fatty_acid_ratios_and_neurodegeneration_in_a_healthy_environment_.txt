Title: Omega fatty acid ratios and neurodegeneration in a healthy environment.
PMID: 37977351

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis pose substantial public health challenges. While genetics play a primary role, recent research emphasizes the impact of environmental factors, particularly diet and lifestyle. This study investigates the initiating effects of Omega (ω)- 3 and Omega (ω)- 6 fatty acids on neuroinflammation, potentially contributing to these diseases. Using BV-2 microglial cells, we explored the influence of different fatty acid compositions and ratios on cell viability, cytokine production, morphological changes, and lipid peroxidation. Notably, a 2/1 ω-6:ω-3 ratio led to decreased cell viability. Fatty acid compositions influenced cytokine secretion, with reduced TNF-α suggesting anti-inflammatory effects. IL-17 increased, while IL-4 and IL-10 decreased in the 15/1 ω-6:ω-3 ratio, indicating complex cytokine interactions. This study found that polyunsaturated fatty acids interventions induced microglial activation, altering cell morphology even without immunostimulants. These findings demonstrate the intricate nature of fatty acid interactions with microglial cells and their potential implications for neuroinflammation. Further research is needed to clarify mechanisms and their relevance to neurodegenerative diseases, informing possible therapeutic strategies.
