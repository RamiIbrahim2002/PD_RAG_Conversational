Title: The Impact of Polypharmacy on Management of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Parkinson'sÂ Disease.
PMID: 37651023

Abstract:
Lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms are a common presentation of autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). Symptoms significantly impact quality of life and are associated with worsening of motor symptoms and increased risk for falls. Different medical co-morbidities can often contribute to LUT symptoms, and a thorough evaluation therefore becomes essential. The effects of medications used for Parkinson's disease and other co-existing medical co-morbidities on LUT symptoms is often underestimated. Treatment options include behavioural therapy, oral agents such as antimuscarinic and beta-3 receptor agonist agents, botulinum toxin and neuromodulation. The first-line oral agents cause adverse effects that may exacerbate pre-existing Parkinson's disease-related symptoms. Furthermore, these oral agents can interact with other medications used in Parkinson's disease, and the challenges posed by interactions on pharmacological effects and metabolism are discussed. Knowledge about drug interactions can help in effective management of such patients and mitigate the risks for developing adverse effects.
