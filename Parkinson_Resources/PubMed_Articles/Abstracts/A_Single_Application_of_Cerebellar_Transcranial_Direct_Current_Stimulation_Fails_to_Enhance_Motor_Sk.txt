Title: A Single Application of Cerebellar Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Fails to Enhance Motor Skill Acquisition in Parkinson's Disease: A Pilot Study.
PMID: 37626716

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to numerous impairments in motor function that compromise the ability to perform activities of daily living. Practical and effective adjunct therapies are needed to complement current treatment approaches in PD. Transcranial direct current stimulation applied to the cerebellum (c-tDCS) can increase motor skill in young and older adults. Because the cerebellum is involved in PD pathology, c-tDCS application during motor practice could potentially enhance motor skill in PD. The primary purpose was to examine the influence of c-tDCS on motor skill acquisition in a complex, visuomotor isometric precision grip task (PGT) in PD in the OFF-medication state. The secondary purpose was to determine the influence of c-tDCS on transfer of motor skill in PD. The study utilized a double-blind, SHAM-controlled, within-subjects design. A total of 16 participants completed a c-tDCS condition and a SHAM condition in two experimental sessions separated by a 7-day washout period. Each session involved practice of the PGT concurrent with either c-tDCS or SHAM. Additionally, motor transfer tasks were quantified before and after the practice and stimulation period. The force error in the PGT was not significantly different between the c-tDCS and SHAM conditions. Similarly, transfer task performance was not significantly different between the c-tDCS and SHAM conditions. These findings indicate that a single session of c-tDCS does not elicit acute improvements in motor skill acquisition or transfer in hand and arm tasks in PD while participants are off medications.
