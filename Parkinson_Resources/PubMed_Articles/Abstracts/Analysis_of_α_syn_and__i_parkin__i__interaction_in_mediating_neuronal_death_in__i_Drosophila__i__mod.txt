Title: Analysis of α-syn and <i>parkin</i> interaction in mediating neuronal death in <i>Drosophila</i> model of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38239290

Abstract:
One of the hallmarks of Parkinson's Disease (PD) is aggregation of incorrectly folded α-synuclein (<i>SNCA</i>) protein resulting in selective death of dopaminergic neurons. Another form of PD is characterized by the loss-of-function of an E3-ubiquitin ligase, <i>parkin</i>. Mutations in <i>SNCA</i> and <i>parkin</i> result in impaired mitochondrial morphology, causing loss of dopaminergic neurons. Despite extensive research on the individual effects of <i>SNCA</i> and <i>parkin</i>, their interactions in dopaminergic neurons remain understudied. Here we employ <i>Drosophila</i> model to study the effect of collective overexpression of <i>SNCA</i> along with the downregulation of <i>parkin</i> in the dopaminergic neurons of the posterior brain. We found that overexpression of <i>SNCA</i> along with downregulation of <i>parkin</i> causes a reduction in the number of dopaminergic neuronal clusters in the posterior region of the adult brain, which is manifested as progressive locomotor dysfunction. Overexpression of <i>SNCA</i> and downregulation of <i>parkin</i> collectively results in altered mitochondrial morphology in a cluster-specific manner, only in a subset of dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Further, we found that <i>SNCA</i> overexpression causes transcriptional downregulation of <i>parkin</i>. However, this downregulation is not further enhanced upon collective <i>SNCA</i> overexpression and <i>parkin</i> downregulation. This suggests that the interactions of <i>SNCA</i> and <i>parkin</i> may not be additive. Our study thus provides insights into a potential link between α<i>-synuclein</i> and <i>parkin</i> interactions. These interactions result in altered mitochondrial morphology in a cluster-specific manner for dopaminergic neurons over a time, thus unraveling the molecular interactions involved in the etiology of Parkinson's Disease.
