Title: A guide to selecting high-performing antibodies for Rab1A and Rab1B for use in Western Blot, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence.
PMID: 38559361

Abstract:
Rab1 is a highly conserved small GTPase that exists in humans as two isoforms: Rab1A and Rab1B, sharing 92% sequence identity. These proteins regulate vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi and within the Golgi stacks. Rab1A and Rab1B may be oncogenes, as they are frequently dysregulated in various human cancers. Moreover, they contribute to the progression of Parkinson's disease. The availability of high-quality antibodies specific for Rab1A or Rab1B is essential to understand the distinct functions of these Rab1 proteins in both health and diseaseand to enhance the reproducibility of research involving these proteins. In this study, we characterized seven antibodies targeting Rab1A and five antibodies targeting Rab1B for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a much larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address the antibody reproducibility issue by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a valuable resource for the scientific community. While uses of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.
