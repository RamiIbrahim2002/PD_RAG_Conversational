Title: Protective Role of <i>AMPK</i> against <i>PINK1</i><sup><i>B9</i></sup> Flies' Neurodegeneration with Improved Mitochondrial Function.
PMID: 37868355

Abstract:
Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (<i>AMPK</i>)'s effect in <i>PTEN</i>-induced kinase 1 (<i>PINK1</i>) mutant Parkinson's disease (PD) transgenic flies and the related mechanism is seldom studied. The classic <i>MHC-Gal4/UAS</i> PD transgenic flies was utilized to generate the disease characteristics specifically expressed in flies' muscles, and Western blot (WB) was used to measure the expression of the activated form of <i>AMPK</i> to investigate whether activated <i>AMPK</i> alters in <i>PINK1</i><sup><i>B9</i></sup> PD flies. <i>MHC-Gal4</i> was used to drive <i>AMPK</i> overexpression in <i>PINK1</i><sup><i>B9</i></sup> flies to demonstrate the crucial role of <i>AMPK</i> in PD pathogenesis. The abnormal wing posture and climbing ability of <i>PINK1</i><sup><i>B9</i></sup> PD transgenic flies were recorded. Mitochondrial morphology via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ATP and NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S3 (NDUFS3) protein levels were tested to evaluate the alteration of the mitochondrial function in <i>PINK1</i><sup><i>B9</i></sup> PD flies. Phosphorylated AMPK<i>Î±</i> dropped significantly in <i>PINK1</i><sup><i>B9</i></sup> flies compared to controls, and <i>AMPK</i> overexpression rescued <i>PINK</i><sup><i>B9</i></sup> flies' abnormal wing posture rate. The elevated dopaminergic neuron number in PPL1 via immunofluorescent staining was observed. Mitochondrial dysfunction in <i>PINK1</i><sup><i>B9</i></sup> flies has been ameliorated with increased ATP level, restored mitochondrial morphology in muscle, and increased NDUFS3 protein expression. Conclusively, <i>AMPK</i> overexpression could partially rescue the PD flies via improving <i>PINK1</i><sup><i>B9</i></sup> flies' mitochondrial function.
