Title: Potentiometric detection of apomorphine in human plasma using a 3D printed sensor.
PMID: 38154328

Abstract:
Apomorphine is a dopamine agonist that is used for the management of Parkinson's disease and has been proven to effectively decrease the off-time duration, where the symptoms recur, in Parkinson's disease patients. This paper describes the design and fabrication of the first potentiometric sensor for the determination of apomorphine in bulk and human plasma samples. The fabrication protocol involves stereolithographic 3D printing, which is a unique tool for the rapid fabrication of low-cost sensors. The solid-contact apomorphine ion-selective electrode combines a carbon-mesh/thermoplastic composite as the ion-to-electron transducer and a 3D printed ion-selective membrane, doped with the ionophore calix[6]arene. The sensor selectively measures apomorphine in the presence of other biologically present cations - sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium - as well as the commonly prescribed Parkinson's pharmaceutical, levodopa (L-Dopa). The sensor demonstrated a linear, Nernstian response, with a slope of 58.8 mV/decade over the range of 5.0 mM-9.8 μM, which covers the biologically (and pharmaceutically) relevant ranges, with a limit of detection of 2.51 μM. Moreover, the apomorphine sensor exhibited good stability (minimal drift of just 188 μV/hour over 10 h) and a shelf-life of almost 4 weeks. Experiments performed in the presence of albumin, the main plasma protein to which apomorphine binds, demonstrate that the sensor responds selectively to free-apomorphine (i.e., not bound or complexed forms). The utility of the sensor was confirmed through the successful determination of apomorphine in spiked human plasma samples.
