Title: Nanowired delivery of dl-3-n-butylphthalide with antibodies to alpha synuclein potentiated neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease with emotional stress.
PMID: 37783563

Abstract:
Stress is one of the most serious consequences of life leading to several chronic diseases and neurodegeneration. Recent studies show that emotional stress and other kinds of anxiety and depression adversely affects Parkinson's disease symptoms. However, the details of how stress affects Parkinson's disease is still not well known. Traumatic brain injury, stroke, diabetes, post-traumatic stress disorders are well known to modify the disease precipitation, progression and persistence. However, show stress could influence Parkinson's disease is still not well known. The present investigation we examine the role of immobilization stress influencing Parkinson's disease brain pathology in model experiments. In ore previous report we found that mild traumatic brain injury exacerbate Parkinson's disease brain pathology and nanodelivery of dl-3-n-butylphthalide either alone or together with mesenchymal stem cells significantly attenuated Parkinson's disease brain pathology. In this chapter we discuss the role of stress in exacerbating Parkinson's disease pathology and nanowired delivery of dl-3-n-butylphthalide together with monoclonal antibodies to alpha synuclein (ASNC) is able to induce significant neuroprotection. The possible mechanisms of dl-3-n-butylphthalide and ASNC induced neuroprotection and suitable clinical therapeutic strategy is discussed.
