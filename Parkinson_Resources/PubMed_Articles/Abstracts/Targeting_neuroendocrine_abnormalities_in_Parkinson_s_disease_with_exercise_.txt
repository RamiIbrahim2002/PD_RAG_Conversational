Title: Targeting neuroendocrine abnormalities in Parkinson's disease with exercise.
PMID: 37746149

Abstract:
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a prevalent and complex age-related neurodegenerative condition for which there are no disease-modifying treatments currently available. The pathophysiological process underlying PD remains incompletely understood but increasing evidence points to multiple system dysfunction. Interestingly, the past decade has produced evidence that exercise not only reduces signs and symptoms of PD but is also potentially neuroprotective. Characterizing the mechanistic pathways that are triggered by exercise and lead to positive outcomes will improve understanding of how to counter disease progression and symptomatology. In this review, we highlight how exercise regulates the neuroendocrine system, whose primary role is to respond to stress, maintain homeostasis and improve resilience to aging. We focus on a group of hormones - cortisol, melatonin, insulin, klotho, and vitamin D - that have been shown to associate with various non-motor symptoms of PD, such as mood, cognition, and sleep/circadian rhythm disorder. These hormones may represent important biomarkers to track in clinical trials evaluating effects of exercise in PD with the aim of providing evidence that patients can exert some behavioral-induced control over their disease.
