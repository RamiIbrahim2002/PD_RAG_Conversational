Title: Anesthetic Management of a Patient With Parkinson's Disease and a Deep Brain Stimulator Device for Hemiarthroplasty Surgery: A Case Report.
PMID: 37546148

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. The multisystem effects of the disease and its pharmacological treatment have several anesthetic implications. With increasing duration of therapy, pharmacoresistance develops. Deep brain stimulation is a safe and effective treatment for symptom control in advanced PD. Its titratability and reversibility make it an attractive treatment option, and it has replaced surgical ablative procedures for advanced disease management. These devices have several implications in the perioperative period. A case is presented of a 75-year-old patient for urgent hemiarthroplasty surgery with advanced PD and a deep brain stimulator device in situ.
