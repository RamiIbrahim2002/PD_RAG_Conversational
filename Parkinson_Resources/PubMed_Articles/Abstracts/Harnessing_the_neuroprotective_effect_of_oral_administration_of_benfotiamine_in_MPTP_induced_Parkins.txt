Title: Harnessing the neuroprotective effect of oral administration of benfotiamine in MPTP induced Parkinson's disease in rats.
PMID: 38043777

Abstract:
The study was performed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of Benfotiamine (BFT) in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) in rats. The rats were given daily doses of BFT (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg) through oral administration for 42 days. The rats were given a single bilateral dosage of MPTP (0.1 mg/nostril) intranasally once before the drug treatment to induce PD. On day 42, the animals were subjected to various behavioral paradigms. Post-treatment with BFT for 42 days significantly improved the motor and nonmotor fluctuations of MPTP. The results demonstrated that treatment with BFT ameliorated MPTP-induced disorders in behavior, body balance, and dopamine levels in the mid-brain. Among the post-treated groups, a high dose of BFT was the most effective treatment. Mean values are indicated in ±SEM, n = 5***(p < 0.001) when compared with the vehicle control, n = 5 ### (p < 0.001) when compared with the disease control; (p < 0.001) when compared with the BFT per se; (p < 0.001) when compared with the low dose of BFT; (p < 0.001) when compared with the high dose of BFT. Our finding suggests that BFT contributed to superior antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory and could be a novel therapeutic method for PD management. In conclusion, BFT could be a potential drug candidate for curbing and preventing PD.
