Title: The Development and Full Validation of a Novel Liquid Chromatography Electrochemical Detection Method for Simultaneous Determination of Nine Catecholamines in Rat Brain.
PMID: 37933822

Abstract:
Chemical neurotransmission, managed by neurotransmitters, has a crucial role in brain processes such as fear, memory, learning, and pain, or neuropathology such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, anxiety/depression, and Parkinson's disease. The measurement of these compounds is used to elucidate the disease mechanisms and evaluate the outcomes of therapeutic interventions. However, this can be quite difficult because of various matrix effects and the problems of chromatographic separation of analysts. In the current study; for the first time, an optimized and fully validated high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC) method according to Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency Bioanalytical Validation Guidance was developed for the simultaneous analysis of nine neurotransmitter compounds, namely dopamine, homovanilic acid, vanilmandelic acid, serotonin (SER), 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglycol, norepinephrine, 3,4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 3-methoxytyramine and simultaneously determined in rat brain samples.
