Title: Polysorbate 80 surface modified SLNs of formoterol suppress SNCA gene and mitochondrial oxidative stress in mice model of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37968340

Abstract:
The present study hypothesises that the selective brain β2 receptor activation through β2-adrenoreceptor agonist (β2ARA), Formoterol (FMT), suppresses SNCA gene expression, a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) in brain. Further, it is also hypothesized that brain targeted delivery of Formoterol via polysorbate-80 surface modified solid lipid nanoparticles of Formoterol (FMT-SLNs-PS80) can improve its stability, therapeutic efficacy and avoid/reduce peripheral off-target side effects. FMT-SLNs-PS80 was prepared by solvent injection method, the formulation was optimized by using Box-Behnken design and characterized by measuring drug content, entrapment efficacy, particle size, zeta potentials and poly dispersibility. The FMT-SLNs-PS80, significantly decreases the SNCA expression, mitochondrial membrane damage and rotenone induced changes in oxidative (SOD, CAT, GSH and ROS) stress markers in SH-SY5Y cell lines. The ex vivo permeation study of the formulation using everted chicken ileum exhibited a steady state flux. The pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies of the formulation in rats showed a significant improvement in the kinetic parameters when compared to naïve FMT, further the formulation also improved the brain bioavailability of FMT. The anti-Parkinson's efficacy studies of the formulation in mice showed a significant neuroprotection against rotenone-induced changes in behavioural and biochemical parameters. Further, the histopathological analysis of mice brain confirms a significant neuroprotective benefit. The present study successfully establishes the brain targeted delivery and anti-Parkinson's therapeutic efficacy of FMT-SLNs-PS80.
