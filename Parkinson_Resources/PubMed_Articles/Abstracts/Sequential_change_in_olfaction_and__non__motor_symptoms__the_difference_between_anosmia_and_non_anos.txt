Title: Sequential change in olfaction and (non) motor symptoms: the difference between anosmia and non-anosmia in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37533763

Abstract:
Hyposmia is a common prodrome in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This study investigates whether olfactory changes in PD differ according to the degree of olfactory dysfunction and whether there are changes in motor and non-motor symptoms.
