Title: Increased diversity of <i>Malassezia</i> species on the skin of Parkinson's disease patients.
PMID: 37854034

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor disorders and the composition of Lewy bodies (LBs) in the substantia nigra. Due to the lack of a definitive biomarker, the current treatments do not modify the progression of PD. Recently, researchers revealed lipid dysregulation and some potential volatile biomarkers of PD related to a unique odor from PD patients by metabolomics of sebum, which is supposed to cause a potential change for skin microflora. In this study, we identified the 4 <i>Malassezia</i> species in PD patients and compared them with healthy controls.
