Title: Multimodal learning of clinically accessible tests to aid diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders: a scoping review.
PMID: 37489153

Abstract:
With ageing populations around the world, there is a rapid rise in the number of people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the two most common types of neurodegenerative disorders. There is an urgent need to find new ways of aiding early diagnosis of these conditions. Multimodal learning of clinically accessible data is a relatively new approach that holds great potential to support early precise diagnosis. This scoping review follows the PRSIMA guidelines and we analysed 46 papers, comprising 11,750 participants, 3569 with AD, 978 with PD, and 2482 healthy controls; the recency of this topic was highlighted by nearly all papers being published in the last 5 years. It highlights the effectiveness of combining different types of data, such as brain scans, cognitive scores, speech and language, gait, hand and eye movements, and genetic assessments for the early detection of AD and PD. The review also outlines the AI methods and the model used in each study, which includes feature extraction, feature selection, feature fusion, and using multi-source discriminative features for classification. The review identifies knowledge gaps around the need to validate findings and address limitations such as small sample sizes. Applying multimodal learning of clinically accessible tests holds strong potential to aid the development of low-cost, reliable, and non-invasive methods for early detection of AD and PD.
