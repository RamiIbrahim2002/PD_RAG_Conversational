Abstract:
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is increasingly being used for Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the evaluation of its clinical impact remains complex owing to the heterogeneity of patients and treatments. Therefore, we used a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced PD rat model to investigate whether anodal tDCS of the primary motor cortex (M1) alleviates PD motor deficits. Before tDCS treatment, unilateral PD rats preferentially used the forelimb ipsilateral to the lesion in the exploratory cylinder test and showed reduced locomotor activity in the open field test. In addition, PD-related clumsy forelimb movements during treadmill walking were detected using deep learning-based video analysis (DeepLabCut). When the 5-day tDCS treatment began, the forelimb-use asymmetry was ameliorated gradually, and locomotor activity increased to pre-lesion levels. tDCS treatment also normalized unnatural forelimb movement during walking and restored a balanced gait. However, these therapeutic effects were rapidly lost or gradually disappeared when the tDCS treatment was terminated. Histological analysis at the end of the experiment revealed that the animals had moderately advanced PD, with 40-50% of dopamine neurons and fibers preserved on the injured side compared with those on the intact side. Although it remains a challenge to elucidate the neural mechanisms of the transient improvement in motor function induced by tDCS, the results of this study provide evidence that tDCS of the M1 produces positive behavioral outcomes in PD animals and provides the basis for further clinical research examining the application of tDCS in patients with PD.
