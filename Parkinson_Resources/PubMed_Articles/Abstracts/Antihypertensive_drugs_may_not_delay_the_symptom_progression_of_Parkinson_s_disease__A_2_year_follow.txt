PMID: 37560660

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disease, and half of PD patients have hypertension as well. The effect of antihypertensive drugs on the progression of PD has been less studied. The focus of this study was on the changes in dopamine transporter (DAT) levels to assess the effect of antihypertensive drugs on the progression of PD.
