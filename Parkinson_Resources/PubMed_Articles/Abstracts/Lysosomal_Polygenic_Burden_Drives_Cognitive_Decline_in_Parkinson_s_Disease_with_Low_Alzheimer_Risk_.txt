Title: Lysosomal Polygenic Burden Drives Cognitive Decline in Parkinson's Disease with Low Alzheimer Risk.
PMID: 38124396

Abstract:
Genetics influence cognitive progression in Parkinson's disease, possibly through mechanisms related to Lewy and Alzheimer's disease pathology. Lysosomal polygenic burden has recently been linked to more severe Lewy pathology post mortem.
