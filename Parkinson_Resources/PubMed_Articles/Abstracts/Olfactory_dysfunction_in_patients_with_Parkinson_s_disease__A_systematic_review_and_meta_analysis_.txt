Title: Olfactory dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PMID: 38425360

Abstract:
<b>Background:</b> Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neuro-degenerative disease and olfactory dysfunction is considered as an important issue in these patients. The prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in patients with PD was reported variously in previous studies. Therefore, we designed this systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in patients with PD. <b>Methods:</b> Two expert researchers systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, references of the papers, and conference abstracts. The titles and abstracts of the potential studies were evaluated after deleting the duplicates. We extracted data regarding the total number of participants, first author, publication year, the country of origin, mean age, mean disease duration, female/male, number with olfactory dysfunction, and name of the test. We evaluated the risk of potential bias by the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (adapted for cross-sectional studies). All statistical analyses were done using Stata software. To determine heterogeneity between the findings of included studies, inconsistency (I<sup>2</sup>) was calculated. We applied random effect model when I<sup>2</sup> was more than 50%. P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. <b>Results:</b> The literature search revealed 1546 studies; after deleting duplicates, 894 remained. Finally, twelve studies remained for meta-analysis. Studies were published between years of 2009 to 2021, the sample size of studies ranged between 30 and 2097, and the mean age ranged between 61 and 70 years. The pooled prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in patients with PD was estimated as 64% [95% confidence interval (CI): 44-84, I<sup>2</sup> = 99.7%, P < 0.001]. The pooled prevalence of olfactory dysfunction using Sniffin's test was 67% (95% CI: 51-83) and using other tests was 60% (95% CI: 28-92). <b>Conclusion:</b> The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in patients with PD was 64% which should be considered by physicians.
