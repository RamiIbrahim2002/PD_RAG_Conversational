Abstract:
The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that began to spread globally since 2019. Some COVID-19 patients have neurological complications, such as olfactory disorders and movement disorders, which coincide with the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Increasing imaging and autopsy evidence supports that the density of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway is damaged in some COVID-19 patients. However, the underlying mechanism that causes PD-like symptoms remains unclear. PD is an age-related neurodegenerative disease with Lewy bodies (LBs) as its histopathologic feature. The main component of LBs is abnormally aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn). The prion-like propagation of α-syn aggregates plays a key role in the onset and progression of PD. The spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 is a heparin-binding protein that mediates the entry of the virus into host cells. Here we found that the S1 domain interacts with α-syn and promotes α-syn aggregation. The S1 domain induces mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity. The S1-seeded α-syn fibrils show enhanced seeding activity and induce synaptic damage and cytotoxicity. Thus, the S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 promotes the aggregation of α-syn in the cellular model of synucleinopathy and may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.
