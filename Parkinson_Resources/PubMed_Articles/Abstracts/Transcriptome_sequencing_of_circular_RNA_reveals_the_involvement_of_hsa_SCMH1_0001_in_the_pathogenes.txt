Title: Transcriptome sequencing of circular RNA reveals the involvement of hsa-SCMH1_0001 in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37664885

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Exosomes are endosome-derived extracellular vesicles that can take part in intercellular communication. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are noncoding RNAs characterized by covalently closed-loop structures, which perform a crucial function in many diseases.
