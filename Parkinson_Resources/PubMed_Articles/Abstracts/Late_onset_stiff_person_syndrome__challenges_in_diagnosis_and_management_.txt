Title: Late-onset stiff-person syndrome: challenges in diagnosis and management.
PMID: 38152088

Abstract:
Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare slowly progressive autoimmune neuronal hyperexcitability disease with very-high GAD-65 antibody titers that most commonly presents above the age of 20, with muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, slow gait, and falls leading to disability. In other autoimmune disorders, late-onset disease has different symptom-spectrum and outcomes, but there is no information regarding late-onset SPS (LOSPS).
