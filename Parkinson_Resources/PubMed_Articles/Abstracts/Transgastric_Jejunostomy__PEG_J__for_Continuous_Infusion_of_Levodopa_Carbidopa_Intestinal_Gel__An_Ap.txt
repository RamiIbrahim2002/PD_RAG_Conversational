Title: Transgastric Jejunostomy (PEG-J) for Continuous Infusion of Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel: An Approach for Parkinson's Disease Treatment.
PMID: 37571821

Abstract:
BACKGROUND Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that often requires long-term management of motor symptoms. Continuous infusion of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) has shown promising results in alleviating motor fluctuations and improving quality of life. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transgastric jejunostomy (PEG-J) as a delivery method for LCIG in a cohort of 43 PD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-three PD patients who were candidates for LCIG therapy underwent transgastric jejunostomy to facilitate continuous infusion of LCIG. The primary outcomes assessed were motor symptom improvement, reduction in motor fluctuations, and medication-related adverse events. Secondary outcomes included changes in quality of life, dyskinesia severity, and healthcare resource utilization. RESULTS The results of this study demonstrated significant improvements in motor symptoms, reduction in motor fluctuations, and enhanced quality of life following PEG-J for LCIG infusion. The treatment was generally well-tolerated, with a low incidence of procedure-related complications. Notably, the use of PEG-J allowed for precise and continuous delivery of LCIG, minimizing variations in drug absorption and ensuring consistent therapeutic levels. CONCLUSIONS Transgastric jejunostomy (PEG-J) offers an effective approach for the continuous infusion of LCIG in Parkinson's disease treatment. This method provides a stable and reliable delivery system, leading to improved symptom control and enhanced quality of life for PD patients.
