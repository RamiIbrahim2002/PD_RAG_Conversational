Title: PET imaging of synaptic density in Parkinsonian disorders.
PMID: 37814917

Abstract:
Synaptic dysfunction and altered synaptic pruning are present in people with Parkinsonian disorders. Dopamine loss and alpha-synuclein accumulation, two hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology, contribute to synaptic dysfunction and reduced synaptic density in PD. Atypical Parkinsonian disorders are likely to have unique spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic density, differentiating them from PD. Therefore, quantification of synaptic density has the potential to support diagnoses, monitor disease progression, and treatment efficacy. Novel radiotracers for positron emission tomography which target the presynaptic vesicle protein SV2A have been developed to quantify presynaptic density. The radiotracers have successfully investigated synaptic density in preclinical models of PD and people with Parkinsonian disorders. Therefore, this review will summarize the preclinical and clinical utilization of SV2A radiotracers in people with Parkinsonian disorders. We will evaluate how SV2A abundance is associated with other imaging modalities and the considerations for interpreting SV2A in Parkinsonian pathology.
