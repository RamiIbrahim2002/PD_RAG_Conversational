Title: Sleep-related regions in neurodegenerative diseases by central nervous system localization using magnetic resonance imaging.
PMID: 39492095

Abstract:
Sleep disruptions associated with neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) damage the brain's sleep-regulating regions. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques can characterize the signature of each neurodegenerative pathology. We performed an evaluation of sleep-related regions in NDDs using MRI to localize the central nervous system (CNS). In the initial search, 61 related papers were discovered using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, 30 articles were included in this study. The study included patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), idiopathic RBD (iRBD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Sleep-related regions recognized by CNS localization in NDDs can be linked to important regions. MRI also revealed cortical thinning, GM atrophy, WM, and tract loss, changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) biomarkers (fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (Da), and radial diffusivity (Dr)), a decrease in DMN connectivity, a reduction in functional connectivity (FC), and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) alterations. Sleep plays an important role in predicting future risks for the development of NDDs. Other neuroimaging, cognitive-behavioral, and clinical research can use the information found in this research about the brain regions, MRI biomarker changes, and their relationships.
