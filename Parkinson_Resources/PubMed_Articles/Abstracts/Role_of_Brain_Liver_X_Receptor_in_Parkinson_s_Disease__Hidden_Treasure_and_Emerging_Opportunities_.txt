Title: Role of Brain Liver X Receptor in Parkinson's Disease: Hidden Treasure and Emerging Opportunities.
PMID: 37606719

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease due to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (DNs) in the substantia nigra (SN). The liver X receptor (LXR) is involved in different neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the objective of the present review was to clarify the possible role of LXR in PD neuropathology. LXRs are the most common nuclear receptors of transcription factors that regulate cholesterol metabolism and have pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory effects and reducing intracellular cholesterol accumulation. LXRs are highly expressed in the adult brain and act as endogenous sensors for intracellular cholesterol. LXRs have neuroprotective effects against the development of neuroinflammation in different neurodegenerative diseases by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. LXRs play an essential role in mitigating PD neuropathology by reducing the expression of inflammatory signaling pathways, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and enhancement of BDNF signaling.In conclusion, LXRs, through regulating brain cholesterol homeostasis, may be effectual in PD. Also, inhibition of node-like receptor pyrin 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) by LXRs could effectively prevent neuroinflammation in PD. Taken together, LXRs play a crucial role in PD neuropathology by inhibiting neuroinflammation and associated degeneration of DNs.
