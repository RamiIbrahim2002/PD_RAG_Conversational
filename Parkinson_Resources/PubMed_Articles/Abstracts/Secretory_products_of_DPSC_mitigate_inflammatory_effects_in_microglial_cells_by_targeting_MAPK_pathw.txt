Title: Secretory products of DPSC mitigate inflammatory effects in microglial cells by targeting MAPK pathway.
PMID: 38039760

Abstract:
Activated microglial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) are the main contributors to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Inhibiting their activation will help in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress during pathogenesis, potentially limiting the progression of the diseases. The immunomodulation properties of dental pulp-derived stem cells (DPSC) make it a promising therapy for neurodegenerative disorders. This study aims to determine whether secretory factors of DPSC (DPSC<sup>℗</sup>) inhibit inflammation and proliferation of microglial cells and define the molecular mechanisms. Our quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the DPSC<sup>℗</sup> reduced the markers of the inflammation and induced anti-inflammatory molecules in microglial cells. DPSC <sup>℗</sup> reduced the intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential in microglial cells. In addition, DPSC <sup>℗</sup> decreased the cellular bioenergetics parameters related to oxygen consumption rate (OCAR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). We found that DPSC<sup>℗</sup> inhibited microglial cell proliferation by activating a checkpoint molecule, Chk1 leading an arrest at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. To define the mechanism, we performed the western blot analysis and observed that the MAPK P38 pathway was inhibited by DPSC<sup>℗</sup>. Furthermore, a System biology analysis revealed that the BDNF and GDNF, secretory factors of DPSC, blocked at the phosphorylation site (Tyr 182) of the P38 molecule resulting in the inhibition of downstream signaling of inflammation. These data suggest that the DPSC<sup>℗</sup> may be a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases.
