Title: Neuroimmune Connectomes in the Gut and Their Implications in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37840070

Abstract:
The gastrointestinal tract is the largest immune organ and it receives dense innervation from intrinsic (enteric) and extrinsic (sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatosensory) neurons. The immune and neural systems of the gut communicate with each other and their interactions shape gut defensive mechanisms and neural-controlled gut functions such as motility and secretion. Changes in neuroimmune interactions play central roles in the pathogenesis of diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which is a multicentric disorder that is heterogeneous in its manifestation and pathogenesis. Non-motor and premotor symptoms of PD are common in the gastrointestinal tract and the gut is considered a potential initiation site for PD in some cases. How the enteric nervous system and neuroimmune signaling contribute to PD disease progression is an emerging area of interest. This review focuses on intestinal neuroimmune loops such as the neuroepithelial unit, enteric glial cells and their immunomodulatory effects, anti-inflammatory cholinergic signaling and the relationship between myenteric neurons and muscularis macrophages, and the role of Î±-synuclein in gut immunity. Special consideration is given to the discussion of intestinal neuroimmune connectomes during PD and their possible implications for various aspects of the disease.
