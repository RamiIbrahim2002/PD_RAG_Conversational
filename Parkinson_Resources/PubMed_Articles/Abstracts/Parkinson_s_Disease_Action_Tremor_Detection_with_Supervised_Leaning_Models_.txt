Title: Parkinson's Disease Action Tremor Detection with Supervised-Leaning Models.
PMID: 37745176

Abstract:
People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) have multiple symptoms, such as freezing of gait (FoG), hand tremors, speech difficulties, and balance issues, in different stages of the disease. Among these symptoms, hand tremors are present across all stages of the disease. PD hand tremors have critical consequences and negatively impact the quality of PD patients' everyday lives. Researchers have proposed a variety of wearable devices to mitigate PD tremors. However, these devices require accurate tremor detection technology to work effectively while the tremor occurs. This paper introduces a PD action tremor detection method to recognize PD tremors from regular activities. We used a dataset from 30 PD patients wearing accelerometers and gyroscope sensors on their wrists. We selected time-domain and frequency-domain hand-crafted features. Also, we compared our hand-crafted features with existing CNN data-driven features, and our features have more specific boundaries in 2-D feature visualization using the t-SNE tool. We fed our features into multiple supervised machine learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for detecting PD action tremors. These models were evaluated with 30 PD patients' data. The performance of all models using our features has more than 90% of F1 scores in five-fold cross-validations and 88% F1 scores in the leave-one-out evaluation. Specifically, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) perform the best in five-fold cross-validation with over 92% F1 scores. SVMs also show the best performance in the leave-one-out evaluation with over 90% F1 scores.
