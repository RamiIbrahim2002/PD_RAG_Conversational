Abstract:
Autosomal dominant pathogenic mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause Parkinson's disease (PD). The most common mutation, G2019S-LRRK2, increases the kinase activity of LRRK2 causing hyper-phosphorylation of its substrates. One of these substrates, Rab10, is phosphorylated at a conserved Thr73 residue (pRab10), and is one of the most abundant LRRK2 Rab GTPases expressed in various tissues. The involvement of Rab10 in neurodegenerative disease, including both PD and Alzheimer's disease makes pinpointing the cellular and subcellular localization of Rab10 and pRab10 in the brain an important step in understanding its functional role, and how post-translational modifications could impact function. To establish the specificity of antibodies to the phosphorylated form of Rab10 (pRab10), Rab10 specific antisense oligonucleotides were intraventricularly injected into the brains of mice. Further, Rab10 knock out induced neurons, differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells were used to test the pRab10 antibody specificity. To amplify the weak immunofluorescence signal of pRab10, tyramide signal amplification was utilized. Rab10 and pRab10 were expressed in the cortex, striatum and the substantia nigra pars compacta. Immunofluorescence for pRab10 was increased in G2019S-LRRK2 knockin mice. Neurons, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes all showed Rab10 and pRab10 expression. While Rab10 colocalized with endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome and trans-Golgi network markers, pRab10 did not localize to these organelles. However, pRab10, did overlap with markers of the presynaptic terminal in both mouse and human cortex, including Î±-synuclein. Results from this study suggest Rab10 and pRab10 are expressed in all brain areas and cell types tested in this study, but pRab10 is enriched at the presynaptic terminal. As Rab10 is a LRRK2 kinase substrate, increased kinase activity of G2019S-LRRK2 in PD may affect Rab10 mediated membrane trafficking at the presynaptic terminal in neurons in disease.
