Title: The Therapeutic Potential of Hydroxycinnamic Acid Derivatives in Parkinson's Disease: Focus on <i>In Vivo</i> Research Advancements.
PMID: 37432913

Abstract:
Hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (HCDs) are polyphenols that are abundant in cereals, coffee, tea, wine, fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based foods. To aid in the clinical prevention and treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), we evaluated in vivo investigations of the pharmacological properties of HCDs relevant to PD, and their pharmacokinetic and safety aspects. An extensive search of published journals was conducted using several literature databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Web of Science. The search terms included "hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives," "ferulic acid," "caffeic acid," "sinapic acid," "p-coumaric acid," "Parkinson's disease," and combinations of these keywords. As of April 2023, 455 preclinical studies were retrieved, of which 364 were in vivo studies; we included 17 of these articles on the pharmaceutics of HCDs in PD. Available evidence supports the protective effects of HCDs in PD due to their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, as well as antiapoptotic physiological activities. Studies have identified possible molecular targets and pathways for the protective actions of HCDs in PD. However, the paucity of studies on these compounds in PD, and the risk of toxicity induced with high-dose applications, limits their use. Thus, multifaceted studies of HCDs in vitro and in vivo are needed.
