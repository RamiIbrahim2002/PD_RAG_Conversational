Title: Dysphagia in Neurological Disorders.
PMID: 37579785

Abstract:
Dysphagia is a common symptom in many neurologic disorders. Patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia present with difficulties when they start to swallow, often with coughing and choking; whereas patients with esophageal dysphagia describe the feeling that swallowed food stops in the chest. Chronic neurologic diseases such stroke, Parkinson's disease, or dementia often have dysphagia as a symptom, particularly oropharyngeal dysphagia, and the term "neurogenic dysphagia" is often used. A disruption of the sophisticated, integrated sensorimotor swallowing system is usually the main reason behind dysphagia. Dysphagia can be associated with aspiration leading to aspiration pneumonia, and chronic dysphagia can lead to weight loss and malnutrition. Patients with dysphagia, when accurately and promptly diagnosed through medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests, often can be treated and experience improved quality of life. The pathophysiological mechanisms behind dysphagia, its diagnosis, and potential treatments are discussed in this manuscript.
