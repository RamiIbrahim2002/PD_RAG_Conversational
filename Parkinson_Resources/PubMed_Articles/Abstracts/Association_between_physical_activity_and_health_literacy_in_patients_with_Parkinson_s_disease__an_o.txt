PMID: 37957558

Abstract:
For patients with Parkinson's disease (PwPD), promotion of habitual physical activity (PA) assists in the prevention of disease progression. Patients' health literacy (HL) is integral for meeting PA standards and turning it into a habit. This study evaluated the association between PA level and each HL domain in PwPD.
