Title: Correlation Between Substantia Nigra Hyperechogenicity and Iron Metabolism in the Postural Instability Gait Difficulty Subtype of Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37666708

Abstract:
The correlation between substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity on transcranial sonography (TCS) and serum iron metabolism parameters in patients with the postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype of Parkinson's disease (PD) was investigated so as to explore the pathological mechanism of SN hyperechogenicity.
