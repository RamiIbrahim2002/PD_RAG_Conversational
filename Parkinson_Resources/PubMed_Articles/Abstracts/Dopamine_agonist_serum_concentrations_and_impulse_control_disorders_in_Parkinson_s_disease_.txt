Title: Dopamine agonist serum concentrations and impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37955562

Abstract:
Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are common among Parkinson's disease patients using dopamine agonists. We wanted to determine whether ICD patients have higher dopamine agonist serum concentrations than those without any sign of ICD.
