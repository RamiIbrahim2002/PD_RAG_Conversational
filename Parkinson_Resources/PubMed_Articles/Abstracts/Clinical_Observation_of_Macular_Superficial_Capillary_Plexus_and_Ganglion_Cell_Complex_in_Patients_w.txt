Title: Clinical Observation of Macular Superficial Capillary Plexus and Ganglion Cell Complex in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37562366

Abstract:
We investigated macular superficial capillary plexus (SCP) density and the thicknesses of the ganglion cell complex (GCC) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and correlated them. We also observed the correlations between SCP density and clinical parameters of PD patients. The retina might be a novel biomarker of PD and will be useful in the future for the early diagnosis of PD and detecting disease progression.
