PMID: 37745647

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are at greater risk for cognitive decline and RBD has been associated with alterations in sleep-related EEG oscillations. This study evaluates differences in sleep quantitative EEG (qEEG) and cognition in PD participants with (PD-RBD) and without RBD (PD-no-RBD).
