PMID: 37594550

Abstract:
The prevalence of sarcopenia (reduced skeletal muscle strength and mass), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Parkinson's related disorders (PRD) all increase with age. They also share risk factors and pathogenetic features. An increased prevalence of sarcopenia in PD and PRD than the general population was thus postulated.
