Title: Four Days Are Enough to Provide a Reliable Daily Step Count in Mild to Moderate Parkinson's Disease through a Commercial Smartwatch.
PMID: 37960670

Abstract:
Daily steps could be a valuable indicator of real-world ambulation in Parkinson's disease (PD). Nonetheless, no study to date has investigated the minimum number of days required to reliably estimate the average daily steps through commercial smartwatches in people with PD. Fifty-six patients were monitored through a commercial smartwatch for 5 consecutive days. The total daily steps for each day was recorded and the average daily steps was calculated as well as the working and weekend days average steps. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (3,k), standard error of measurement (SEM), Bland-Altman statistics, and minimum detectable change (MDC) were used to evaluate the reliability of the step count for every combination of 2-5 days. The threshold for acceptability was set at an ICC ≥ 0.8 with a lower bound of CI 95% ≥ 0.75 and a SAM < 10%. ANOVA and Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare steps across the days and between the working and weekend days, respectively. Four days were needed to achieve an acceptable reliability (ICC range: 0.84-0.90; SAM range: 7.8-9.4%). In addition, daily steps did not significantly differ across the days and between the working and weekend days. These findings could support the use of step count as a walking activity index and could be relevant to developing monitoring, preventive, and rehabilitation strategies for people with PD.
