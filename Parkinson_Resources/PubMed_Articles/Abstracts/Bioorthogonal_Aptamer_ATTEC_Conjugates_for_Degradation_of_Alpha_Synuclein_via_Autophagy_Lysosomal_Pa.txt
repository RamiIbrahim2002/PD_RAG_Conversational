Title: Bioorthogonal Aptamer-ATTEC Conjugates for Degradation of Alpha-Synuclein via Autophagy-Lysosomal Pathway.
PMID: 37821404

Abstract:
Autophagosome-tethering compound (ATTEC) technology has recently been emerging as a novel approach for degrading proteins of interest (POIs). However, it still faces great challenges in how to design target-specific ATTEC molecules. Aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides that can recognize their target proteins with high specificity and affinity. Here, ATTEC is combined with aptamers for POIs degradation. As a proof of concept, pathological protein α-synuclein (α-syn) is chosen as the target and an efficient α-syn degrader is generated. Aptamer as a targeting warhead of α-syn is conjugated with LC3B-binding compound 5,7-dihydroxy-4-phenylcoumarin (DP) via bioorthogonal click reaction. It is demonstrated that the aptamer conjugated with DP is capable of clearing α-syn through LC3 and autophagic degradation. These results indicate that aptamer-based ATTECs are a versatile approach to degrade POIs by taking advantage of the well-defined different aptamers for targeting diverse proteins, which provides a new way for the design of ATTECs to degradation of targeted proteins.
