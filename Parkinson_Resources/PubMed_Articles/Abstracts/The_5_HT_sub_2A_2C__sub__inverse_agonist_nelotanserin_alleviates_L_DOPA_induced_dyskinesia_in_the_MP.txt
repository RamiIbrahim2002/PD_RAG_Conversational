Abstract:
Nelotanserin is a serotonin 2A and 2C (5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub>) inverse agonist that was previously tested in the clinic for rapid-eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) dementia. Its effect on L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia has however not been investigated. As 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> antagonism/inverse agonism is a validated approach to alleviate dyskinesia, we undertook the current study to evaluate the anti-dyskinetic potential of nelotanserin in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset. Parkinsonism was induced in six common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus, three females and three males) that were then chronically treated with L-DOPA to induce dyskinesia. On experimental days, they were administered L-DOPA in combination with vehicle or nelotanserin (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg) subcutaneously, in a randomised fashion. Dyskinesia and parkinsonism were rated post hoc by a blinded observer. In comparison to vehicle, the addition of nelotanserin 0.3 and 1 mg/kg to L-DOPA diminished peak dose dyskinesia by 47% (P < 0.05) and 69% (P < 0.001). Nelotanserin 0.3 and 1 mg/kg also reduced the severity of global dyskinesia, by 40% (P < 0.01) and 55% (P < 0.001), when compared to vehicle. Nelotanserin 0.1 mg/kg did not alleviate peak dose or global dyskinesia severity. Nelotanserin had no impact on the anti-parkinsonian action of L-DOPA. Our results highlight that nelotanserin may represent an efficacious anti-dyskinetic drug and provide incremental evidence of the potential benefit of 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> antagonism/inverse agonism for drug-induced dyskinesia in PD.
