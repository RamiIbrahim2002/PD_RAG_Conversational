PMID: 37776391

Abstract:
This paper delves into the potential of Pope Francis' Culture of Encounter (CoE) to establish an ethical foundation that undergirds pastoral and health care for persons with Parkinson's Disease (PD), their family members, and caregivers. To achieve this goal, this paper explores the following key themes: First, an in-depth examination of the documented experiences of persons with PD and their families and caregivers. PD, an ailment deemed incurable by medical experts, profoundly impacts the well-being of patients and significantly influences the lives of their family members and caregivers. Second, Pope Francis' CoE teaches fraternal openness and orients people to acknowledge, appreciate, and love one another. Patterned after Christ's compassion, CoE underscores that no one is useless and expendable. Third, CoE furnishes an ethical framework for pastoral care extended to individuals with PD, their families, and caregivers. According to Pope Francis, CoE's effectiveness and positive outcomes restore people and circumstances to their rightful positions - reinstating the dignity of living.
