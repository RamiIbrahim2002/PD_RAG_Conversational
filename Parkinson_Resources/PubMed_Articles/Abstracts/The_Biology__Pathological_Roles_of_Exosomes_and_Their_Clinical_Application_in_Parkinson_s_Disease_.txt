Title: The Biology, Pathological Roles of Exosomes and Their Clinical Application in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37689233

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a high global incidence and places a great burden on the patient, their family and society. Early diagnosis of PD is the key to hindering the progression process and may enable treatment to partially reverse the disease course. Exosomes are lipid bilayers with a diameter of 40-160 nm (average ∼100 nm), show a cup-shaped structure in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, and contain different types of nucleic acids and proteins. On the one hand, several molecules contained in exosomes are correlated with PD pathology. On the other hand, biomarkers based on exosomes have gradually become diagnostic tools in PD. Since exosomes can freely cross the blood-brain barrier, CNS-derived exosomes obtained from the periphery have the potential to be a powerful marker for early PD diagnosis. Of course, exosomes also have great potential as drug delivery systems due to their low toxicity, lipid solubility and immunological inertness. However, there is still a lack of standardized, efficient, and ultrasensitive methods for the isolation of exosomes, hindering the development of effective biomarkers. Therefore, this review describes the biological characteristics of exosomes, exosome extraction methods, and the pathological role, diagnostic/therapeutic value of exosomes in PD.
