Title: Deterioration of Cough, Respiratory, and Vocal Cord Functions in Patients with Multiple System Atrophy.
PMID: 37873834

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to clarify changes in cough function in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). Seventeen probable patients with MSA were studied. Peak cough flow (PCF), respiratory function (percentage of vital capacity, percentage of forced vital capacity, and percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in one second), respiratory muscle strength (percentage of maximal inspiratory mouth pressure and percentage of maximal expiratory mouth pressure), and maximum phonation time (MPT) were assessed. Walking ability, disease duration, possibility of air stacking, Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS), and Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III were also assessed. Data were separately analyzed for ambulatory and non-ambulatory groups categorized by Functional Ambulation Categories. PCF, respiratory function, respiratory muscle strength, and MPT were significantly lower in the non-ambulatory group than in the ambulatory group. On the other hand, no correlation between PCF and disease duration was observed. A significant number of patients in the non-ambulatory group were unable to hold their breath. The UMSARS and MDS-UPDRS Part III in the non-ambulatory group were significantly higher than in the ambulatory group. It was concluded that ambulatory dysfunction is associated with the decline of cough function and respiratory-related function in patients with MSA.
