Title: Effect of deep brain stimulation compared with drug therapy alone on the progression of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38260017

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms deteriorate with disease progression. Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) can effectively improve the motor signs of PD patients, it is not yet known whether DBS surgery, which is an invasive treatment modality, may change the progression of PD.
