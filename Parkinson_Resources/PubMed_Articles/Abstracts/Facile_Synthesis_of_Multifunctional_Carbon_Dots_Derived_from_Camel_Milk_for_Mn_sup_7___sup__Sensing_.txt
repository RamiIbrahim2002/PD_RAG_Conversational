PMID: 37810638

Abstract:
Carbon dots (CDs) are promising biocompatible fluorescent nanoparticles mainly used in bioimaging, drug delivery, sensing, therapeutics, and various other applications. The utilization of natural sources and green synthetic approaches is resulting in highly biocompatible and nontoxic nanoparticles. Herein, we report an unprecedented facile and green synthesis of highly luminescent carbon dots derived from camel milk (CM) for sensing manganese (Mn<sup>7+</sup>) ions and for identifying the anticancer potential and antiamyloid activity against α-synuclein amyloids. α-Synuclein amyloid formation due to protein misfolding (genetic and environmental factors) has gained significant attention due to its association with Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. The as-synthesized CM-CDs possess an average hydrodynamic diameter ranging from 3 to 15 nm and also exhibit strong photoluminescence (PL) emission in the blue region. The CM-CDs possess good water dispersibility, stable fluorescence under different physical states, and outstanding photostability. Moreover, the CM-CDs are validated as an efficient sensor for the detection of Mn<sup>7+</sup> ions in DI water and in metal ion-polluted tap water. In addition, the CM-CDs have demonstrated a very good quantum yield (QY) of 24.6% and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.58 μM for Mn<sup>7+</sup> ions with no incubation time. Consequently, the exceptional properties of CM-CDs make them highly suitable for a diverse array of biomedical applications.
