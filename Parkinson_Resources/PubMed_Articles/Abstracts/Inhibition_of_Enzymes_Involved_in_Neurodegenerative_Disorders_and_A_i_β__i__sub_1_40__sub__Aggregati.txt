Title: Inhibition of Enzymes Involved in Neurodegenerative Disorders and A<i>β</i><sub>1-40</sub> Aggregation by <i>Citrus limon</i> Peel Polyphenol Extract.
PMID: 37687161

Abstract:
Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD) are multifactorial neurogenerative disorders of the Central Nervous System causing severe cognitive and motor deficits in elderly people. Because treatment of AD and PD by synthetic drugs alleviates the symptoms often inducing side effects, many studies have aimed to find neuroprotective properties of diet polyphenols, compounds known to act on different cell signaling pathways. In this article, we analyzed the effect of polyphenols obtained from the agro-food industry waste of <i>Citrus limon</i> peel (LPE) on key enzymes of cholinergic and aminergic neurotransmission, such as butyryl cholinesterase (BuChE) and monoamine oxidases (MAO)-A/B, on A<i>β</i><sub>1-40</sub> aggregation and on superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1/2 that affect oxidative stress. In our in vitro assays, LPE acts as an enzyme inhibitor on BuChE (IC<sub>50</sub> ~ 73 µM), MAO-A/B (IC<sub>50</sub> ~ 80 µM), SOD 1/2 (IC<sub>50</sub> ~ 10-20 µM) and interferes with A<i>β</i><sub>1-40</sub> peptide aggregation (IC<sub>50</sub> ~ 170 µM). These results demonstrate that LPE behaves as a multitargeting agent against key factors of AD and PD by inhibiting to various extents BuChE, MAOs, and SODs and reducing A<i>β</i>-fibril aggregation. Therefore, LPE is a promising candidate for the prevention and management of AD and PD symptoms in combination with pharmacological therapies.
