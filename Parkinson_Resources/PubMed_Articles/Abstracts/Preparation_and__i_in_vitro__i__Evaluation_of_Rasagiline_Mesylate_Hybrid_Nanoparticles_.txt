Title: Preparation and <i>in vitro</i> Evaluation of Rasagiline Mesylate Hybrid Nanoparticles.
PMID: 38028832

Abstract:
Rasagiline is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) that is effective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). It had antioxidant and anti-apoptotic activity in experimental models. Moreover, it has low permeability and its oral bioavailability is weak and highly variable due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism (35%). This study aimed to formulate rasagiline mesylate (RM) as a lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle in order to enhance its permeation and increase its chance to be absorbed by lymphatic circulation to avoid metabolism and control its release. Successful formulation (PCL-2) was reached by the nanoprecipitation method using polycaprolactone with RM in the organic phase and lecithin in the aqueous phase DSPE-PEG. The lipid:polymer ratio of 24% and DSPE: lecithin of 50% resulted in stable nanoparticles having a particle size of 132±4.58 nm, polydispersity index of 0.273±0.02, zeta potential of -25.6±3.3, entrapment efficiency of 46±3.9%, and drug loading of 51.93±6.5. Results showed that the diffusion was more effective on the release profile than the degradation and resulted in a Fickian diffusion mechanism.
