Title: Cell reprogramming therapy for Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38526281

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease is typically characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Many studies have been performed based on the supplementation of lost dopaminergic neurons to treat Parkinson's disease. The initial strategy for cell replacement therapy used human fetal ventral midbrain and human embryonic stem cells to treat Parkinson's disease, which could substantially alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in clinical practice. However, ethical issues and tumor formation were limitations of its clinical application. Induced pluripotent stem cells can be acquired without sacrificing human embryos, which eliminates the huge ethical barriers of human stem cell therapy. Another widely considered neuronal regeneration strategy is to directly reprogram fibroblasts and astrocytes into neurons, without the need for intermediate proliferation states, thus avoiding issues of immune rejection and tumor formation. Both induced pluripotent stem cells and direct reprogramming of lineage cells have shown promising results in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, there are also ethical concerns and the risk of tumor formation that need to be addressed. This review highlights the current application status of cell reprogramming in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, focusing on the use of induced pluripotent stem cells in cell replacement therapy, including preclinical animal models and progress in clinical research. The review also discusses the advancements in direct reprogramming of lineage cells in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, as well as the controversy surrounding in vivo reprogramming. These findings suggest that cell reprogramming may hold great promise as a potential strategy for treating Parkinson's disease.
