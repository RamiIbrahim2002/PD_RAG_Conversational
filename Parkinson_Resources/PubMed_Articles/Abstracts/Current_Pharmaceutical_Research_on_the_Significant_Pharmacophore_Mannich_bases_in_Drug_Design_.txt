PMID: 37807407

Abstract:
A multitude of distinct Mannich bases have been synthesized and evaluated as potential therapeutics for a wide variety of diseases and medical conditions, either in the form of prodrugs or as molecules that trigger a biological response from specific targets. The Mannich reaction has been utilized to enhance the biological activity of numerous compounds, resulting in notable progress in various areas such as anticonvulsant, antimalarial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antibacterial, antimicrobial, antitubercular, antiprotozoal, topoisomerases I and II inhibition, Î±-glucosidase inhibition, carbonic anhydrase inhibition, as well as research related to anti-Alzheimer's disease and anti-Parkinson's disease. Bioactive semisynthetic Mannich bases derived from natural compounds such as chalcone, curcumin, and thymol have also been identified. Pharmaceutical compounds characterized by low solubility may encounter challenges related to their oral bioavailability, half-life, distribution within tissues, rapid metabolism, toxicity, and various other relevant variables. Mannich bases have the ability to undergo protonation under physiological circumstances, facilitating interactions between ligands and receptors, and enhancing their solubility in water. The experimental findings indicate that the solubility of Mannich base prodrugs is higher compared to that of the parent compound. The use of the multicomponent Mannich reaction has been established as a valuable synthetic methodology for the construction of multifunctional compounds through the application of diverse synthetic strategies under varying reaction conditions. The continuous investigation of synthetic techniques for Mannich reactions involves several approaches, such as employing protocols in aquatic environments, utilizing catalysts that are both biodegradable and reusable, exploring the use of ionic liquids, investigating solvent-free and/or catalyst-free media, and exploring reaction conditions involving microwave and ultrasound irradiation. Consequently, the Mannich reaction has emerged as a powerful technique in the field of medicinal chemistry. It is utilized for the creation of new chemical compounds that possess diverse and attractive biologic features. Additionally, this reaction is employed to alter the physicochemical properties of a potential drug candidate, thereby influencing its bioavailability, efficacy, and pharmacological activity. Due to their favorable bioactivities and synthesis techniques, Mannich bases remain a subject of ongoing attention in the field of medicinal/pharmaceutical chemistry.
