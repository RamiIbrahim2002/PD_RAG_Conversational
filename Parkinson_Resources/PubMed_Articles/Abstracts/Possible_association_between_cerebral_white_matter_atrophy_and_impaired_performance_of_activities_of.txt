Title: Possible association between cerebral white matter atrophy and impaired performance of activities of daily living in patients with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37818687

Abstract:
The contribution of brain abnormalities in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) to impaired functional status remains uncertain. Our study assessed whether global and regional brain structural abnormalities are associated with impaired performance of activities of daily living (ADL) in PD patients.
