Title: Advances in non-pharmacological management of Parkinson's disease complicated with blood pressure abnormalities.
PMID: 37865954

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) often presents with autonomic dysregulation, leading to blood pressure irregularities such as neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH), neurogenic supine hypertension (nSH), and postprandial hypotension (PPH). Unfortunately, these conditions remain prevalent and receive insufficient attention in scientific discourse. They not only cause complications like syncope, falls, and fractures but also result in long-term damage to vital organs, diminishing patients' quality of life. Early implementation of appropriate non-pharmacologic management is crucial to prevent severe adverse events later on. This review focuses on the types, clinical characteristics, mechanisms, and common non-pharmacologic management measures for PD complicated by abnormal blood pressure. By promoting early diagnosis, recognizing symptoms of abnormal blood pressure, and employing non-pharmacologic interventions such as health education, dietary adjustments, exercise, and Chinese medicine techniques, we aim to improve patients' symptoms and quality of life while providing practical guidance for managing PD-related blood pressure abnormalities.
