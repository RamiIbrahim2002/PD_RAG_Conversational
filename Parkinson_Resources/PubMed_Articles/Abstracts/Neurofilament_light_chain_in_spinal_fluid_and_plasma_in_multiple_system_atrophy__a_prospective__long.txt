Title: Neurofilament light chain in spinal fluid and plasma in multiple system atrophy: a prospective, longitudinal biomarker study.
PMID: 37603107

Abstract:
There is a critical need for reliable diagnostic biomarkers as well as surrogate markers of disease progression in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Neurofilament light chain (NfL) has been reported to potentially meet those needs. We therefore sought to explore the value of NfL in plasma (NfL-p) in contrast to cerebrospinal fluid (NfL-c) as a diagnostic marker of MSA, and to assess NfL-p and NfL-c as markers of clinical disease progression.
