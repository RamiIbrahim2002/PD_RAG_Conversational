Title: The Impact of Head-Up Tilt Sleeping on Orthostatic Tolerance: A Scoping Review.
PMID: 37626994

Abstract:
To systematically summarize the evidence of head-up tilt sleeping (HUTS) on orthostatic tolerance, we conducted a systematic, predefined search in PubMed, OVID Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science. We included studies assessing the effect of HUTS on orthostatic tolerance and other cardiovascular measures and rated the quality with the American Academy of Neurology risk of bias tool. We included 10 studies (<i>n</i> = 185) in four groups: orthostatic hypotension (OH; 6 studies, <i>n</i> = 103), vasovagal syncope (1 study, <i>n</i> = 12), nocturnal angina pectoris (1 study, <i>n</i> = 10) and healthy subjects (2 studies, <i>n</i> = 58). HUTS duration varied (1 day-4 months) with variable inclinations (5°-15°). In two of six OH studies, HUTS significantly improved standing systolic blood pressure. Orthostatic tolerance was consistently enhanced in OH studies with higher angles (≥12°), in 2 out of 3 with smaller angles (5°) but also in one studying horizontal sleeping. In vasovagal syncope, HUTS significantly augmented resilience to extreme orthostatic stress. One study was rated as a class II risk of bias, one of Class II/III and eight of Class IV. The evidence favouring HUTS to improve orthostatic tolerance is weak due to variable interventions, populations, small samples and a high risk of bias. Despite this, we found some physiological signs suggesting a beneficial effect.
