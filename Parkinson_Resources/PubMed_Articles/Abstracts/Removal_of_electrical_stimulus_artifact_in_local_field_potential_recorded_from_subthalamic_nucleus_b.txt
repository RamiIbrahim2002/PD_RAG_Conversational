Title: Removal of electrical stimulus artifact in local field potential recorded from subthalamic nucleus by using manifold denoising.
PMID: 38145720

Abstract:
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, local field potentials (LFPs) recorded through lead externalization during high-frequency stimulation (HFS) are contaminated by stimulus artifacts, which require to be removed before further analysis.
