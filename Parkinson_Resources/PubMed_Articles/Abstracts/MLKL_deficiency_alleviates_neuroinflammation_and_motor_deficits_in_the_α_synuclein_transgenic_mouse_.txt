Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD), one of the most devastating neurodegenerative brain disorders, is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and deposits of α-synuclein aggregates. Currently, pharmacological interventions for PD remain inadequate. The cell necroptosis executor protein MLKL (Mixed-lineage kinase domain-like) is involved in various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and neurodegenerative diseases; however, its precise role in PD remains unclear. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective role of MLKL inhibition or ablation against primary neuronal cells and human iPSC-derived midbrain organoids induced by toxic α-Synuclein preformed fibrils (PFFs). Using a mouse model (Tg-Mlkl<sup>-/-</sup>) generated by crossbreeding the SNCA A53T synuclein transgenic mice with MLKL knockout (KO)mice, we assessed the impact of MLKL deficiency on the progression of Parkinsonian traits. Our findings demonstrate that Tg-Mlkl<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited a significant improvement in motor symptoms and reduced phosphorylated α-synuclein expression compared to the classic A53T transgenic mice. Furthermore, MLKL deficiency alleviated tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neuron loss and attenuated neuroinflammation by inhibiting the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis of the SN of Tg-Mlkl<sup>-/-</sup> mice revealed a unique cell type-specific transcriptome profile, including downregulated prostaglandin D synthase (PTGDS) expression, indicating reduced microglial cells and dampened neuron death. Thus, MLKL represents a critical therapeutic target for reducing neuroinflammation and preventing motor deficits in PD.
