Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that ranks second in prevalence after Alzheimer's disease. The number of PD diagnoses increases annually. Nevertheless, modern PD treatments merely mitigate symptoms rather than preventing neurodegeneration progression. The creation of an appropriate model to thoroughly study the mechanisms of PD pathogenesis remains a current challenge in biomedicine. Recently, there has been an increase in data regarding the involvement of not only dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra but also astrocytes in the pathogenesis of PD. Cell models based on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their differentiated derivatives are a useful tool for studying the contribution and interaction of these two cell types in PD. Here, we generated two iPSC lines, ICGi034-B and ICGi034-C, by reprogramming peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a patient with a heterozygous mutation c.1226A>G (p.N370S) in the <i>GBA1</i> gene by non-integrating episomal vectors encoding <i>OCT4</i>, <i>KLF4</i>, <i>L-MYC</i>, <i>SOX2</i>, <i>LIN28</i>, and <i>mp53DD</i>. The iPSC lines demonstrate the expression of pluripotency markers and are capable of differentiating into three germ layers. We differentiated the ICGi034-B and ICGi034-C iPSC lines into astrocytes. This resulting cell model can be used to study the involvement of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of GBA-associated PD.
