Title: Naringenin, a Functional Food Component, Improves Motor and Non-Motor Symptoms in Animal Model of Parkinsonism Induced by Rotenone.
PMID: 37796415

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) and other age-related neurodegenerative ailments have a strong link to oxidative stress. Bioflavonoid naringenin has antioxidant properties. The effects of pre- and post-naringenin supplementation on a rotenone-induced PD model were examined in this work. Naringenin (50 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered to rats for two weeks before the administration of rotenone in the pre-treatment phase. In contrast, rotenone (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered for eight days before naringenin (50 mg/kg, p.o.) was supplemented for two weeks in the post-treatment phase. During behavioral investigation, the motor and non-motor signs of PD were observed. Additionally, estimation of neurochemical and biochemical parameters was also carried out. Compared to controls, rotenone treatment substantially increased oxidative stress, altered neurotransmitters, and caused motor and non-motor impairments. Rotenone-induced motor and non-motor impairments were considerably reduced by naringenin supplementation. The supplementation also increased antioxidant enzyme activities and restored the changes in neurotransmitter levels. The findings of this work strongly imply that daily consumption of flavonoids such as naringenin may have a therapeutic potential to combat PD.
