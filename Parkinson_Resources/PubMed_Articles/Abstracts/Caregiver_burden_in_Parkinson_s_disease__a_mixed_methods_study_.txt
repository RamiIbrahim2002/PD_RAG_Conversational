Title: Caregiver burden in Parkinson's disease: a mixed-methods study.
PMID: 37424022

Abstract:
Providing informal care for a person with Parkinson's disease (PD) can be a demanding process affecting several dimensions of a caregiver's life and potentially causing caregiver burden. Despite the emerging literature on caregiver burden in people with PD, little is known about the inter-relationship between quantitative and qualitative findings. Filling this knowledge gap will provide a more holistic approach to develop and design innovations aiming at reducing or even preventing caregiver burden. This study aimed to characterize the determinants of caregiver burden among informal caregivers of persons with PD, in order to facilitate the development of tailored interventions that reduce caregiver burden.
