Title: Involvement of Mitochondria in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 38069350

Abstract:
Mitochondrial dysregulation, such as mitochondrial complex I deficiency, increased oxidative stress, perturbation of mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy, has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Initiating from the observation that mitochondrial toxins cause PD-like symptoms and mitochondrial DNA mutations are associated with increased risk of PD, many mutated genes linked to familial forms of PD, including <i>PRKN</i>, <i>PINK1</i>, <i>DJ-1</i> and <i>SNCA</i>, have also been found to affect the mitochondrial features. Recent research has uncovered a much more complex involvement of mitochondria in PD. Disruption of mitochondrial quality control coupled with abnormal secretion of mitochondrial contents to dispose damaged organelles may play a role in the pathogenesis of PD. Furthermore, due to its bacterial ancestry, circulating mitochondrial DNAs can function as damage-associated molecular patterns eliciting inflammatory response. In this review, we summarize and discuss the connection between mitochondrial dysfunction and PD, highlighting the molecular triggers of the disease process, the intra- and extracellular roles of mitochondria in PD as well as the therapeutic potential of mitochondrial transplantation.
