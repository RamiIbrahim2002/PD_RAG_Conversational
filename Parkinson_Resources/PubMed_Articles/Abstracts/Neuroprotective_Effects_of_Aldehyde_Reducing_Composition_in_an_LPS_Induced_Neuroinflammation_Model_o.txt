Title: Neuroprotective Effects of Aldehyde-Reducing Composition in an LPS-Induced Neuroinflammation Model of Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 38138478

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease in which neuroinflammation and oxidative stress interact to contribute to pathogenesis. This study investigates the in vivo neuroprotective effects of a patented yeast extract lysate in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation model. The yeast extract lysate, named aldehyde-reducing composition (ARC), exhibited potent antioxidant and anti-aldehyde activities in vitro. Oral administration of ARC at 10 or 20 units/kg/day for 3 days prior to intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10 mg/kg) effectively preserved dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum by preventing LPS-induced cell death. ARC also normalized the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the SN, providing further evidence for its neuroprotective properties. In the liver, ARC downregulated the LPS-induced increase in inflammatory cytokines and reversed the LPS-induced decrease in antioxidant-related genes. These findings indicate that ARC exerts potent antioxidant, anti-aldehyde, and anti-inflammatory effects in vivo, suggesting its potential as a disease-modifying agent for the prevention and treatment of neuroinflammation-related diseases, including Parkinson's disease.
