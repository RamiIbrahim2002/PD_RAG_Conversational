Title: Integrated Multimodal Omics and Dietary Approaches for the Management of Neurodegeneration.
PMID: 37754272

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are caused by a combination of multiple events that damage neuronal function. A well-characterized biomarker of neurodegeneration is the accumulation of proteinaceous aggregates in the brain. However, the gradually worsening symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases are unlikely to be solely due to the result of a mutation in a single gene, but rather a multi-step process involving epigenetic changes. Recently, it has been suggested that a fraction of epigenetic alternations may be correlated to neurodegeneration in the brain. Unlike DNA mutations, epigenetic alterations are reversible, and therefore raise the possibilities for therapeutic intervention, including dietary modifications. Additionally, reactive oxygen species may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease through epigenetic alternation. Given that the antioxidant properties of plant-derived phytochemicals are likely to exhibit pleiotropic effects against ROS-mediated epigenetic alternation, dietary intervention may be promising for the management of neurodegeneration in these diseases. In this review, the state-of-the-art applications using single-cell multimodal omics approaches, including epigenetics, and dietary approaches for the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases are discussed.
