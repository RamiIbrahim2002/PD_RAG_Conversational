PMID: 38160602

Abstract:
Outpatient palliative care offers an opportunity to improve the quality of life of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and families. While there are efforts to improve clinicians' palliative care knowledge and skills, there is limited knowledge on patients and carepartners' knowledge and perceptions of palliative care. As part of a larger study on implementing outpatient palliative care, this study aimed to understand patients' and carepartners' knowledge and perceptions of palliative care, and their palliative care needs and preferences prior to the implementation.
