Title: Long-Term Outcomes of Hyperadrenergic Orthostatic Hypotension.
PMID: 37790494

Abstract:
Hyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension is a subtype of orthostatic hypotension associated with elevated norepinephrine levels upon standing. Our previous study found that this subtype is characterized by less severe autonomic impairment compared to orthostatic hypotension with normal or low norepinephrine levels. However, long-term outcomes have not been determined. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the all-cause mortality and phenoconversion over 7 years.
