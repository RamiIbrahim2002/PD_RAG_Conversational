Title: Bridging the Gap: Association between Objective and Subjective Outcomes of Communication Performance in People with Parkinson's Disease Evaluated for Deep Brain Stimulation.
PMID: 38094653

Abstract:
Decrements in verbal fluency following deep brain stimulation (DBS) in people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) are common. As such, verbal fluency tasks are used in assessing DBS candidacy and target selection. However, the correspondence between testing performance and the patient's perception of communication abilities is not well-established.
