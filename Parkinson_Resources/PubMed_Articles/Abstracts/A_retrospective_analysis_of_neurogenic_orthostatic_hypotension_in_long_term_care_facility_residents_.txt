Title: A retrospective analysis of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in long-term care facility residents with recurrent falls.
PMID: 38065033

Abstract:
Approximately 50Â % of residents in long-term care facilities fall yearly and orthostatic hypotension accounts for a significant portion of them. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension - a subtype of orthostatic hypotension - is important to be recognized as its management is far more complex; undertreatment of these older adults can lead to recurrent falls, high healthcare cost burden, and increased morbidity and mortality. The primary purpose of our study was to describe the rate of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in older adults in a long-term care facility, with a secondary purpose to describe risk factors for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in this population.
