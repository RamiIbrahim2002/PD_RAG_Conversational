Title: Dessert or Poison? The Roles of Glycosylation in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
PMID: 37440197

Abstract:
Ministry of Education and Key Laboratory of Neurons and glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) are modified by glycosylation and rely on glycosylation to achieve normal neural function. Neurodegenerative disease is a common disease of the elderly, affecting their healthy life span and quality of life, and no effective treatment is currently available. Recent research implies that various glycosylation traits are altered during neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a potential implication of glycosylation in disease pathology. Herein, we summarized the current knowledge about glycosylation associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis, focusing on their promising functional avenues. Moreover, we collected research aimed at highlighting the need for such studies to provide a wealth of disease-related glycosylation information that will help us better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms and hopefully specific glycosylation information to provide further diagnostic and therapeutic directions for neurodegenerative diseases.
