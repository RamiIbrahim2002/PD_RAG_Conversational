Title: Glutathione-Mediated Neuroprotective Effect of Purine Derivatives.
PMID: 37685879

Abstract:
Numerous basic studies have reported on the neuroprotective properties of several purine derivatives such as caffeine and uric acid (UA). Epidemiological studies have also shown the inverse association of appropriate caffeine intake or serum urate levels with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The well-established neuroprotective mechanisms of caffeine and UA involve adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonism and antioxidant activity, respectively. Our recent study found that another purine derivative, paraxanthine, has neuroprotective effects similar to those of caffeine and UA. These purine derivatives can promote neuronal cysteine uptake through excitatory amino acid carrier protein 1 (EAAC1) to increase neuronal glutathione (GSH) levels in the brain. This review summarizes the GSH-mediated neuroprotective effects of purine derivatives. Considering the fact that GSH depletion is a manifestation in the brains of AD and PD patients, administration of purine derivatives may be a new therapeutic approach to prevent or delay the onset of these neurodegenerative diseases.
