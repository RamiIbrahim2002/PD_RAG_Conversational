Title: Polymorphic USP8 allele promotes Parkinson's disease by inducing the accumulation of α-synuclein through deubiquitination.
PMID: 37981592

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neuro-degenerative diseases characterized by α-synuclein accumulation and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Employing genome-wide sequencing, we identified a polymorphic USP8 allele (USP8<sup>D442G</sup>) significantly enriched in Chinese PD patients. To test the involvement of this polymorphism in PD pathogenesis, we derived dopaminergic neurons (DAn) from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) reprogrammed from fibroblasts of PD patients harboring USP8<sup>D442G</sup> allele and their healthy siblings. In addition, we knock-in D442G polymorphic site into the endogenous USP8 gene of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and derived DAn from these knock-in hESCs to explore their cellular phenotypes and molecular mechanism. We found that expression of USP8<sup>D442G</sup> in DAn induces the accumulation and abnormal subcellular localization of α-Synuclein (α-Syn). Mechanistically, we demonstrate that D442G polymorphism enhances the interaction between α-Syn and USP8 and thus increases the K63-specific deubiquitination and stability of α-Syn . We discover a pathogenic polymorphism for PD that represent a promising therapeutic and diagnostic target for PD.
