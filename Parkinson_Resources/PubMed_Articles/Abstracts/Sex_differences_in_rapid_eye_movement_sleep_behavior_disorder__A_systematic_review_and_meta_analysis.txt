Title: Sex differences in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PMID: 37422999

Abstract:
Although rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) has been widely considered as a male-predominant parasomnia, the existing evidence for the sex difference in the risk of RBD in the general population was conflicting. The present study conducted a systematic review to explore the sex differences in the prevalence, comorbidities, clinical characteristics, and phenoconversion of RBD. One hundred thirty-five eligible studies were identified for the systematic review, and 133 were finally included in the meta-analysis. Males in the general population showed a trend for a higher risk of probable/possible RBD (pRBD), especially among the male older adults (aged â‰¥60). In the clinical populations, males showed a significantly higher risk of confirmed RBD, but not of pRBD. Among idiopathic RBD (iRBD) patients, males had a significantly earlier age onset of RBD compared with females. Male patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) had a higher risk of comorbid RBD. There was no significant sex difference in the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases in iRBD patients. Large scale and prospective studies utilizing stringent diagnostic criteria for RBD are recommended to further verify the sex differences in RBD and to investigate the mechanism underlying the sex difference.
