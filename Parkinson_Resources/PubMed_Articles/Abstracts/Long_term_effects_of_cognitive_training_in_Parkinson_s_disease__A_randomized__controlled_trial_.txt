Title: Long-term effects of cognitive training in Parkinson's disease: A randomized, controlled trial.
PMID: 38107671

Abstract:
Computerized cognitive training may be promising to improve cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and has even been suggested to delay cognitive decline. However, evidence to date is limited. The aim of this study was to assess the durability of eight-week cognitive training effects at up to two years follow-up.
