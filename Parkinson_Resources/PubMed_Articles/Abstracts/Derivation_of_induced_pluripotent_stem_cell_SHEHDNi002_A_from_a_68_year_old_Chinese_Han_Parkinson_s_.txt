Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common movement disorder. In this study, we generated an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line from the dermal fibroblasts of a 68-year-old female patient, carrying LRRK2 and DNAJC6 mutations. This iPSC line will be a useful tool for investigating the pathogenesis and for developing treatment for PD.
