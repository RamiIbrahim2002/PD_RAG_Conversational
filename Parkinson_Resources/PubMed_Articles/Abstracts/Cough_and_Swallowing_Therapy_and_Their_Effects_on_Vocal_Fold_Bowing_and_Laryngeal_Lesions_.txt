Title: Cough and Swallowing Therapy and Their Effects on Vocal Fold Bowing and Laryngeal Lesions.
PMID: 37497803

Abstract:
Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) and sensorimotor training of airway protection (smTAP) are two exercises intended to improve cough and swallowing in people with Parkinson's Disease (PwPD). The aims of this study were to (1) examine whether EMST or smTAP elicit changes to vocal fold bowing; and (2) describe the safety of EMST and smTAP as it relates to the development of vocal fold lesions.
