Title: Effects of movement congruence on motor resonance in early Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37689819

Abstract:
The observation of action seems to involve the generation of the internal representation of that same action in the observer, a process named motor resonance (MR). The objective of this study was to verify whether an experimental paradigm of action observation in a laboratory context could elicit cortical motor activation in 21 early Parkinson's disease (PD) patients compared to 22 controls. Participants were instructed to simply observe (observation-only session) or to respond (Time-to-contact detection session) at the instant the agent performed a grasping action toward a graspable or ungraspable object. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy with 20 channels on the motor and premotor brain areas and event-related desynchronization of alpha-mu rhythm. In both groups, response times were more accurate in graspable than ungraspable object trials, suggesting that motor resonance is present in PD patients. In the Time-to-contact detection session, the oxyhemoglobin levels and alpha-mu desynchronization prevailed in the graspable object trials rather than in the ungraspable ones. This study demonstrates the preservation of MR mechanisms in early PD patients. The action observation finalized to a consequent movement can activate cortical networks in patients with early PD, suggesting early rehabilitation interventions taking into account specific observation paradigms preceding motor production.
