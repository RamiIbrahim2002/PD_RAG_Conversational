PMID: 37948972

Abstract:
Pre-existing neurological diseases have been identified as risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection and death. There is a lack of comprehensive literature review assessing the relationship between pre-existing neurological conditions and COVID-19 outcomes. Identification of high risk groups is critical for optimal treatment and care.
