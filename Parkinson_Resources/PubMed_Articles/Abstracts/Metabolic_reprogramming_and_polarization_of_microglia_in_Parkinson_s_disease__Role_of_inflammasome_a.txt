Title: Metabolic reprogramming and polarization of microglia in Parkinson's disease: Role of inflammasome and iron.
PMID: 37572760

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by Î±-synuclein aggregation and dopaminergic neuronal death. Recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is an early event in the pathogenesis of PD. Microglia are resident immune cells in the central nervous system that can be activated into either pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes as found in peripheral macrophages. To exert their immune functions, microglia respond to various stimuli, resulting in the flexible regulation of their metabolic pathways. Inflammasomes activation in microglia induces metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, and leads to the polarization of microglia to pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, finally causing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In addition, iron accumulation induces microglia take an inflammatory and glycolytic phenotype. M2 phenotype microglia is more sensitive to ferroptosis, inhibition of which can attenuate neuroinflammation. Therefore, this review highlights the interplay between microglial polarization and metabolic reprogramming of microglia. Moreover, it will interpret how inflammasomes and iron regulate microglial metabolism and phenotypic shifts, which provides a promising therapeutic target to modulate neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
