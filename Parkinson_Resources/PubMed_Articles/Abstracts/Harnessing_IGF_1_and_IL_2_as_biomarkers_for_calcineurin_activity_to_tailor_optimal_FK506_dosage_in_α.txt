Abstract:
<b>Introduction:</b> Rise in Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and hyperactive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phosphatase calcineurin represent two key determinants of a-synuclein (a-syn) pathobiology implicated in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Calcineurin activity can be inhibited with FK506, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compound. Our previous work demonstrated a protective effect of low doses of FK506 against a-syn pathology in various models of a-syn related pathobiology. <b>Methods:</b> Control and a-syn-expressing mice (12-18 months old) were injected with vehicle or two single doses of FK506 administered 4 days apart. Cerebral cortex and serum from these mice were collected and assayed using a meso scale discovery quickplex SQ 120 for cytokines and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IGF-1. <b>Results</b>: In this study we present evidence that reducing calcineurin activity with FK506 in a-syn transgenic mice increased insulin growth factor (IGF-1), while simultaneously decreasing IL-2 levels in both cerebral cortex and serum. <b>Discussion:</b> The highly conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calcineurin signaling pathway is known to be affected in a-syn-dependent human disease. FK506, an already approved drug for other uses, exhibits high brain penetrance and a proven safety profile. IL-2 and IGF-1 are produced throughout life and can be measured using standard clinical methods. Our findings provide two potential biomarkers that could guide a clinical trial of FK506 in PD patients, without posing significant logistical or regulatory challenges.
