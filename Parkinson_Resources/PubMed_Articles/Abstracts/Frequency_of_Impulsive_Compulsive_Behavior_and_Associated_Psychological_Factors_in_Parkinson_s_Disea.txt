Title: Frequency of Impulsive-Compulsive Behavior and Associated Psychological Factors in Parkinson's Disease: Lack of Control or Too Much of It?
PMID: 38003991

Abstract:
<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs) including pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive eating, compulsive buying, and other related behaviors are well-known distinct non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Some large-scale studies present a prevalence of at least 10%, however, there are other reports providing much higher rates. The majority of the conducted studies investigating ICDs focus mainly on pharmacological factors, however, from a psychological perspective, there is yet enough room for investigation. In order to address the above issues, we designed a two-part study. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> First, we aimed to identify the incidence of ICD and related behaviors in a cohort of 892 Greek PD patients. Second, we administered a comprehensive battery of psychometric tools to assess psychological factors such as personality dimensions, quality of life, defenses, coherence, and resilience as well as to screen general cognitive capacity in PD patients with ICD manifestations. <i>Results:</i> With regard to the first part, we identified ICD manifestations in 12.4% of the patients. Preliminary findings from the second part indicate elevated activity, rather than impulsivity, as well as interrelations between several variables, including measures of activity, coping mechanisms, and quality of life. <i>Conclusions:</i> We present a working hypothesis for the contribution of high activity channeled to specific behavioral patterns through specific coping mechanisms, concerning the emergence of ICDs and related behaviors in PD, and further stress the importance of compulsivity rather than impulsivity in this process.
