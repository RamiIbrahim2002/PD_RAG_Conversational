Title: Protective Effect of a New Monophenolic Antioxidant TS-13 in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37466856

Abstract:
The development of means of the prevention and treatment of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, as well as geroprotectors, among other things, is based on the inflammatory and free radical theories of aging. In this context, we studied the effect of sodium monophenol 3-(3'-tert-butyl-4'-hydroxyphenyl)propyl thiosulfonate (TS-13) on the behavioral and locomotor activity of C57BL/6 mice in modeling Parkinson's disease by MPTP neurotoxin injection. TS-13 administration significantly improved orientation and exploratory activity and emotional response of the animals in the open field test, but did not affect the increase in anxiety caused by MPTP injection. Long-term (6 months) TS-13 administration did not suppress spontaneous motor activity in BALB/c mice and slightly increased their exploratory activity.
