Title: Striatal dopamine transporter uptake, parkinsonism and cognition in Alzheimer's disease.
PMID: 37493955

Abstract:
The correlates of motor parkinsonism in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain controversial. The effects of nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration on parkinsonism and cognition in biomarker-validated patients with AD were evaluated.
