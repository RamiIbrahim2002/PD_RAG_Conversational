Title: Cardiac sympathetic "morbidity" might reflect the neurobiology of early Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37864716

Abstract:
An appropriate extracranial biomarker that delineates endophenotypes of Parkinson's disease (PD) at an early stage and reflects the neurodegenerative process is lacking. An evaluation of myocardial sympathetic nerve terminals could be a good candidate. This study aimed to explore subtypes of PD patients that showed cardiac catecholaminergic vesicular defect and their characteristics.
