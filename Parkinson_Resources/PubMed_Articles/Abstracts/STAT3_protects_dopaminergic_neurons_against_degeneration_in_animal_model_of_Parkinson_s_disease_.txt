Title: STAT3 protects dopaminergic neurons against degeneration in animal model of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38030102

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent disorder of the basal ganglia, propagated by the degeneration of axon terminals within the striatum and subsequent loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Exposure of environmental neurotoxins and mutations of several mitochondrial and proteasomal genes are primarily responsible.
