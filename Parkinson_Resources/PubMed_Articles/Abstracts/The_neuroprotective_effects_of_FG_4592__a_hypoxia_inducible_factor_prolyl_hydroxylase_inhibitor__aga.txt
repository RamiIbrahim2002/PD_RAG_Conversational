Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The pathological hallmark of PD is the appearance of intraneuronal cytoplasmic α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregation, called Lewy bodies. α-Syn aggregation is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Oxidative stress is also associated with the progression of PD. In the present study, to investigate whether a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylase (PH) inhibitor, FG-4592 (also called roxadustat), has neuroprotective effects against α-Syn-induced neurotoxicity, we employed a novel α-Syn stably expressing cell line (named α-Syn-N2a cells) utilizing a piggyBac transposon system. In α-Syn-N2a cells, oxidative stress and cell death were induced by α-Syn, and FG-4592 showed significant protection against this neurotoxicity. However, FG-4592 did not affect α-Syn protein levels. FG-4592 triggered heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression downstream of HIF-1α in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, FG-4592 decreased the production of reactive oxygen species possibly via the activation of HO-1 and subsequently suppressed α-Syn-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, FG-4592 regulated mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration via the induction of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α. As FG-4592 has various neuroprotective effects against α-Syn and is involved in drug repositioning, it may have novel therapeutic potential for PD.
