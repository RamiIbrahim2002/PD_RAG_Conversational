Title: Conductive PEDOT:PSS copolymer electrode coatings for selective detection of dopamine in ex vivo mouse brain slices.
PMID: 37774451

Abstract:
A novel voltammetric sensor was developed to selectively determine dopamine (DA) concentration in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). This sensor utilizes a modified pencil graphite electrode (PGE) coated with a newly synthesized poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT):poly (styrene sulfonate-co-2-(3-(6-Methyl-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyrimidin-2-yl) ureido) ethyl methacrylate) (P(SS-co-UPyMA)) composite. The PEDOT:P(SS-co-UPyMA) (PPU) composite was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray photoelectron, and Raman spectroscopies. The PPU-coated PGE was characterized using electrochemical techniques, including cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry. Compared to uncoated, PPU-coated PGE demonstrated improved sensitivity and selectivity for DA. The sensor exhibited a dynamic linear range of 0.1-300 μM for DA, with a detection limit of 44.4 nM (S/N = 3). Additionally, the PPU-coated PGE showed high reproducibility and storage stability for four weeks. To demonstrate its practical applicability, the PPU-coated PGE sensor was used for ex vivo brain slice samples from control and Parkinson's disease model mice.
