Title: Home initiation of apomorphine infusion: lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for current clinical practice.
PMID: 37870634

Abstract:
Starting Parkinson's disease (PD) patients on subcutaneous apomorphine (APO) infusion is generally undertaken on a hospital day-case basis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, day-case facilities were unavailable. To avoid delays in treatment, a new procedure was developed for initiation of APO therapy in the patient's home. A home initiation protocol was developed and followed for each patient in this analysis. The hospital team worked in collaboration with APO nurses provided by the manufacturer of APO therapies to implement initiation and undertake follow-up. In this analysis, 27 PD patients were initiated onto APO infusion and 21 (77.8%) achieved a therapeutic response. Home initiation of APO infusion can be undertaken successfully and has benefits for both patients and healthcare teams. This protocol will now continue as a standard of care at our centre.
