PMID: 38041761

Abstract:
Although the effect of spirituality in chronic disease has been discussed in recent years, little is known about spirituality and spiritual beliefs in Parkinson's disease. In this scoping review, the databases PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were searched and initially identified 914 studies. A total of nine studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. It was found age, gender, education level, emotional changes, region of onset of Parkinson's disease, severity of symptoms, quality of life, religion affiliation and acceptance of Parkinson's disease influence spirituality in people with Parkinson's disease. In this context, future studies should focus on the relationship between Parkinson's disease and spirituality.
