PMID: 37954904

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that poses a worldwide public health challenge. A neuroimaging biomarker would significantly improve early diagnosis and intervention, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for affected individuals and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
