Title: Assessing impulse control behaviors in early Parkinson's disease: a longitudinal study.
PMID: 37954646

Abstract:
Impulse control behaviors (ICBs) frequently coexist with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the predictors of ICBs in PD remain unclear, and there is limited data on the biological correlates of ICBs in PD. In this study, we examined clinical, imaging, and biological variables to identify factors associated with longitudinal changes in ICBs in early-stage PD.
