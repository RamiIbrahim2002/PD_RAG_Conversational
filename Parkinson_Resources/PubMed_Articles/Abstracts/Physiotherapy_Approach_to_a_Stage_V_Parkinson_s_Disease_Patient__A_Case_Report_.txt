PMID: 38022080

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused due to decreased dopamine, a neurotransmitter, advancing to a range of motor and non-motor attributes. There is a death of dopamine-producing neurons (dopaminergic neurons) in the Substantia Nigra. Bradykinesia, postural instability, resting tremor, and rigidity are four main symptoms in this patient. A variety of other symptoms, like hypomimia, micrographia, freezing gait, decreased movement amplitude, constipation, cognitive impairments, etc., can be seen in this patient. In this paper, we report a 62-year-old female with stage 5 PD with chief complaints of uncoordinated movements, weakness, and difficulty in daily activities. She was treated with strengthening, stretching, Lee SilvermanÂ Voice Treatment (LSVT) BIG, bed mobility, gait training with auditory cueing, balance training, etc. LSVT-BIG enhances motor function by incorporating high amplitude motions of high intensity, consisting of numerous repetitions and progressive complexity. At the end of three weeks, the patient had improved strength, static and dynamic balance, gait, and quality of life.
