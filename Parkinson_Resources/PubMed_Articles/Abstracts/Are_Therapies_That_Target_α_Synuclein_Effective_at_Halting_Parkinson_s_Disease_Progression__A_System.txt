Title: Are Therapies That Target α-Synuclein Effective at Halting Parkinson's Disease Progression? A Systematic Review.
PMID: 37446200

Abstract:
There are currently no pharmacological treatments available that completely halt or reverse the progression of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Hence, there is an unmet need for neuroprotective therapies. Lewy bodies are a neuropathological hallmark of PD and contain aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn) which is thought to be neurotoxic and therefore a suitable target for therapeutic interventions. To investigate this further, a systematic review was undertaken to evaluate whether anti-α-syn therapies are effective at preventing PD progression in preclinical in vivo models of PD and via current human clinical trials. An electronic literature search was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE (Ovid), PubMed, the Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane databases to collate clinical evidence that investigated the targeting of α-syn. Novel preclinical anti-α-syn therapeutics provided a significant reduction of α-syn aggregations. Biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis of rodent brain tissue demonstrated that treatments reduced α-syn-associated pathology and rescued dopaminergic neuronal loss. Some of the clinical studies did not provide endpoints since they had not yet been completed or were terminated before completion. Completed clinical trials displayed significant tolerability and efficacy at reducing α-syn in patients with PD with minimal adverse effects. Collectively, this review highlights the capacity of anti-α-syn therapies to reduce the accumulation of α-syn in both preclinical and clinical trials. Hence, there is potential and optimism to target α-syn with further clinical trials to restrict dopaminergic neuronal loss and PD progression and/or provide prophylactic protection to avoid the onset of α-syn-induced PD.
