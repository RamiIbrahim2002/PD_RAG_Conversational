Title: Corynoxine B targets at HMGB1/2 to enhance autophagy for <i>α</i>-synuclein clearance in fly and rodent models of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37425041

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disease. It is featured by abnormal alpha-synuclein (<i>α</i>-syn) aggregation in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Macroautophagy (autophagy) is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process for degradation of cellular contents, including protein aggregates, to maintain cellular homeostasis. Corynoxine B (Cory B), a natural alkaloid isolated from <i>Uncaria rhynchophylla</i> (Miq.) Jacks., has been reported to promote the clearance of <i>α</i>-syn in cell models by inducing autophagy. However, the molecular mechanism by which Cory B induces autophagy is not known, and the <i>α</i>-syn-lowering activity of Cory B has not been verified in animal models. Here, we report that Cory B enhanced the activity of Beclin 1/VPS34 complex and increased autophagy by promoting the interaction between Beclin 1 and HMGB1/2. Depletion of HMGB1/2 impaired Cory B-induced autophagy. We showed for the first time that, similar to HMGB1, HMGB2 is also required for autophagy and depletion of HMGB2 decreased autophagy levels and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase III activity both under basal and stimulated conditions. By applying cellular thermal shift assay, surface plasmon resonance, and molecular docking, we confirmed that Cory B directly binds to HMGB1/2 near the C106 site. Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> studies with a wild-type <i>α</i>-syn transgenic drosophila model of PD and an A53T <i>α</i>-syn transgenic mouse model of PD, Cory B enhanced autophagy, promoted <i>α</i>-syn clearance and improved behavioral abnormalities. Taken together, the results of this study reveal that Cory B enhances phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase III activity/autophagy by binding to HMGB1/2 and that this enhancement is neuroprotective against PD.
