Title: Non-Invasive Drug Delivery across the Blood-Brain Barrier: A Prospective Analysis.
PMID: 38004577

Abstract:
Non-invasive drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents a significant advancement in treating neurological diseases. The BBB is a tightly packed layer of endothelial cells that shields the brain from harmful substances in the blood, allowing necessary nutrients to pass through. It is a highly selective barrier, which poses a challenge to delivering therapeutic agents into the brain. Several non-invasive procedures and devices have been developed or are currently being investigated to enhance drug delivery across the BBB. This paper presents a review and a prospective analysis of the art and science that address pharmacology, technology, delivery systems, regulatory approval, ethical concerns, and future possibilities.
