Title: Eleven Crucial Pesticides Appear to Regulate Key Genes That Link MPTP Mechanism to Cause Parkinson's Disease through the Selective Degeneration of Dopamine Neurons.
PMID: 37508933

Abstract:
Pesticides kill neurons, but the mechanism leading to selective dopaminergic loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown. Understanding the pesticide's effect on dopaminergic neurons (DA) can help to screen and treat PD. The critical uptake of pesticides by the membrane receptors at DA is hypothesized to activate a signaling cascade and accelerate degeneration. Using MPTP as a reference, we demonstrate the mechanisms of eleven crucial pesticides through molecular docking, protein networks, regulatory pathways, and prioritization of key pesticide-regulating proteins. Participants were recruited and grouped into control and PD based on clinical characteristics as well as pesticide traces in their blood plasma. Then, qPCR was used to measure pesticide-associated gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells between groups. As a result of molecular docking, all eleven pesticides and the MPTP showed high binding efficiency against 274 membrane receptor proteins of DA. Further, the protein interaction networks showed activation of multiple signaling cascades through these receptors. Subsequent analysis revealed 31 biological pathways shared by all 11pesticides and MPTP that were overrepresented by 46 crucial proteins. Among these, CTNNB1, NDUFS6, and CAV1 were prioritized to show a significant change in gene expression in pesticide-exposed PD which guides toward therapy.
