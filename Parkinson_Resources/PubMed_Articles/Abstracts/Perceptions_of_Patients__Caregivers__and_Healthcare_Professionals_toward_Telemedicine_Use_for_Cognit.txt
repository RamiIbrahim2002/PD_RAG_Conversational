PMID: 38247978

Abstract:
Patients with neurodegenerative diseases who live in remote areas often have limited access to specialized healthcare, and telemedicine represents a useful solution. The aim of this study was to investigate the perceptions toward the use of a specialized-tertiary telemedicine service of patients with cognitive and movement disorders, caregivers, and local healthcare professionals (HPs) in the Aegean Islands.
