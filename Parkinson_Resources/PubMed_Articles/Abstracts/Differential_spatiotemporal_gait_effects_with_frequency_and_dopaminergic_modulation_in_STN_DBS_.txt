Title: Differential spatiotemporal gait effects with frequency and dopaminergic modulation in STN-DBS.
PMID: 37842127

Abstract:
The spatiotemporal gait changes in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) remain a treatment challenge and have variable responses to L-dopa and subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS). The purpose of this study was to determine whether low-frequency STN-DBS (LFS; 60 Hz) elicits a differential response to high-frequency STN-DBS (HFS; 180 Hz) in spatiotemporal gait kinematics.
