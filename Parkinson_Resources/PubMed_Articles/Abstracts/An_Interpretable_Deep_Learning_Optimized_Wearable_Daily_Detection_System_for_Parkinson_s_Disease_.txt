PMID: 37695969

Abstract:
Walking detection in the daily life of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is of great significance for tracking the progress of the disease. This study aims to implement an accurate, objective, and passive detection algorithm optimized based on an interpretable deep learning architecture for the daily walking of patients with PD and to explore the most representative spatiotemporal motor features. Five inertial measurement units attached to the wrist, ankle, and waist are used to collect motion data from 100 subjects during a 10-meter walking test. The raw data of each sensor are subjected to the continuous wavelet transform to train the classification model of the constructed 6-channel convolutional neural network (CNN). The results show that the sensor located at the waist has the best classification performance with an accuracy of 98.01%±0.85% and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9981±0.0017 under ten-fold cross-validation. The gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that the feature points with greater contribution to PD were concentrated in the lower frequency band (0.5~3Hz) compared with healthy controls. The visual maps of the 3D CNN show that only three out of the six time series have a greater contribution, which is used as a basis to further optimize the model input, greatly reducing the raw data processing costs (50%) while ensuring its performance (AUC=0.9929±0.0019). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to consider the visual interpretation-based optimization of an intelligent classification model in the intelligent diagnosis of PD.
