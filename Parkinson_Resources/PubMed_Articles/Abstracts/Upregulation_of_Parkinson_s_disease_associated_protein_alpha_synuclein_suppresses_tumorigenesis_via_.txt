Abstract:
Numerous epidemiological studies suggest a link between Parkinson's disease (PD) and cancer, indicating that PD-associated proteins may mediate the development of cancer. Here, we investigated a potential role of PD-associated protein α-synuclein in regulating liver cancer progression in vivo and in vitro. We found the negative correlation of α-synuclein with metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and γ-synuclein by analyzing the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, liver cancer patients and hepatoma cells with overexpressed α-synuclein. Moreover, upregulated α-synuclein suppressed the growth, migration, and invasion. α-synuclein was found to associate with mGluR5 and γ-synuclein, and the truncated N-terminal of α-synuclein was essential for the interaction. Furthermore, overexpressed α-synuclein exerted the inhibitory effect on hepatoma cells through the degradation of mGluR5 and γ-synuclein via α-synuclein-dependent autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). Consistently, in vivo experiments with rotenone-induced rat model of PD also confirmed that, upregulated α-synuclein in liver cancer tissues through targeting on mGluR5/α-synuclein/γ-synuclein complex inhibited tumorigenesis involving in ALP-dependent degradation of mGluR5 and γ-synuclein. These findings give an insight into an important role of PD-associated protein α-synuclein accompanied by the complex of mGluR5/α-synuclein/γ-synuclein in distant communications between PD and liver cancer, and provide a new strategy in therapeutics for the treatment of liver cancer.
