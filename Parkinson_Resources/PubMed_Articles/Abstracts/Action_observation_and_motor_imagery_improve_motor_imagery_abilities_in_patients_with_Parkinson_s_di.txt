Title: Action observation and motor imagery improve motor imagery abilities in patients with Parkinson's disease - A functional MRI study.
PMID: 37774517

Abstract:
Motor imagery (MI) skills can be affected in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed at assessing MI and brain functional changes after action observation and MI training (AOT-MI) associated with gait/balance exercises in PD patients with postural instability and gait disorders (PD-PIGD).
