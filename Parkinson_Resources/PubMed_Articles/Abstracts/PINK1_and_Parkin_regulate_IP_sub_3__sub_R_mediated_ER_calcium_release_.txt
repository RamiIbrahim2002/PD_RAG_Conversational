Title: PINK1 and Parkin regulate IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated ER calcium release.
PMID: 37626046

Abstract:
Although defects in intracellular calcium homeostasis are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that loss of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin leads to dysregulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) activity, robustly increasing ER calcium release. In addition, we identify that CDGSH iron sulfur domain 1 (CISD1, also known as mitoNEET) functions downstream of Parkin to directly control IP<sub>3</sub>R. Both genetic and pharmacologic suppression of CISD1 and its Drosophila homolog CISD (also known as Dosmit) restore the increased ER calcium release in PINK1 and Parkin null mammalian cells and flies, respectively, demonstrating the evolutionarily conserved regulatory mechanism of intracellular calcium homeostasis by the PINK1-Parkin pathway. More importantly, suppression of CISD in PINK1 and Parkin null flies rescues PD-related phenotypes including defective locomotor activity and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Based on these data, we propose that the regulation of ER calcium release by PINK1 and Parkin through CISD1 and IP<sub>3</sub>R is a feasible target for treating PD pathogenesis.
