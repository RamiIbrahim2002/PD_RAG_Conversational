Title: Fluorinated Isoindolinone-Based Glucosylceramide Synthase Inhibitors with Low Human Dose Projections.
PMID: 38229758

Abstract:
Inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD), particularly in patients where glycosphingolipid accumulation and lysosomal impairment are thought to be contributing to disease progression. Herein, we report the late-stage optimization of an orally bioavailable and CNS penetrant isoindolinone class of GCS inhibitors. Starting from advanced lead <b>1</b>, we describe efforts to identify an improved compound with a lower human dose projection, minimal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux, and acceptable pregnane X receptor (PXR) profile through fluorine substitution. Our strategy involved the use of predicted volume ligand efficiency to advance compounds with greater potential for low human doses down our screening funnel. We also applied minimized electrostatic potentials (<i>V</i><sub>min</sub>) calculations for hydrogen bond acceptor sites to rationalize P-gp SAR. Together, our strategies enabled the alignment of a lower human dose with reduced P-gp efflux, and favorable PXR selectivity for the discovery of compound <b>12</b>.
