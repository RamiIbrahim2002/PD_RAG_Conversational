Title: Automatic labeling of Parkinson's Disease gait videos with weak supervision.
PMID: 37480795

Abstract:
Motor dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients is typically assessed by clinicians employing the Movement Disorder Society's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Such comprehensive clinical assessments are time-consuming, expensive, semi-subjective, and may potentially result in conflicting labels across different raters. To address this problem, we propose an automatic, objective, and weakly-supervised method for labeling PD patients' gait videos. The proposed method accepts videos of patients and classifies their gait scores as normal (Gait score in MDS-UPDRS = 0) or PD (MDS-UPDRS â‰¥ 1). Unlike previous work, the proposed method does not require a priori MDS-UPDRS ratings for training, utilizing only domain-specific knowledge obtained from neurologists. We propose several labeling functions that classify patients' gait and use a generative model to learn the accuracy of each labeling function in a self-supervised manner. Since results depended upon the estimated values of the patients' 3D poses, and existing pre-trained 3D pose estimators did not yield accurate results, we propose a weakly-supervised 3D human pose estimation method for fine-tuning pre-trained models in a clinical setting. Using leave-one-out evaluations, the proposed method obtains an accuracy of 89% on a dataset of 29 PD subjects - a significant improvement compared to previous work by 7%-10% depending upon the dataset. The method obtained state-of-the-art results on the Human3.6M dataset. Our results suggest that the use of labeling functions may provide a robust means to interpret and classify patient-oriented videos involving motor tasks.
