Title: Breaking ground: nursing-led approach to alleviating constipation in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37833627

Abstract:
Constipation is one of the most common non-motor symptoms in PD patients, and the constipation, can appear before motor symptoms. Incorrect treatment of constipation in PD patients can result in colonic volvulus and pseudo intestinal obstruction, as well as a reduction in the therapeutic effect of anti-PD drugs due to absorption issues. There is, however, no comprehensive and scientific nursing intervention plan for PD patients' constipation who are constipated.
