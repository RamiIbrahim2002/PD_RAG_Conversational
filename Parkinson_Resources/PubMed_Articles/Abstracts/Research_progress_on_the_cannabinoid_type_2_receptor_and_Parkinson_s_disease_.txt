Title: Research progress on the cannabinoid type-2 receptor and Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38264546

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is featured by movement impairments, including tremors, bradykinesia, muscle stiffness, and imbalance. PD is also associated with many non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive impairments, dementia, and mental disorders. Previous studies identify the associations between PD progression and factors such as Î±-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and cell death. The cannabinoid type-2 receptor (CB<sub>2</sub> receptor) is a transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor and has been extensively studied as part of the endocannabinoid system. CB<sub>2</sub> receptor is recently emerged as a promising target for anti-inflammatory treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. It is reported to modulate mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, iron transport, and neuroinflammation that contribute to neuronal cell death. Additionally, CB<sub>2</sub> receptor possesses the potential to provide feedback on electrophysiological processes, offering new possibilities for PD treatment. This review summarized the mechanisms underlying PD pathogenesis. We also discussed the potential regulatory role played by CB<sub>2</sub> receptor in PD.
