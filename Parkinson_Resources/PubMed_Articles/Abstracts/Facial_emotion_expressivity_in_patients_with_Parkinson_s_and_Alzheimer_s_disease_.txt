Title: Facial emotion expressivity in patients with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
PMID: 37804428

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are neurodegenerative disorders with some overlapping clinical features. Hypomimia (reduced facial expressivity) is a prominent sign of PD and it is also present in AD. However, no study has experimentally assessed hypomimia in AD and compared facial expressivity between PD and AD patients. We compared facial emotion expressivity in patients with PD, AD, and healthy controls (HCs). Twenty-four PD patients, 24 AD patients and 24 HCs were videotaped during neutral facial expressions and while posing six facial emotions (anger, surprise, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness). Fifteen raters were asked to evaluate the videos using MDS-UPDRS-III (item 3.2) and to identify the corresponding emotion from a seven-forced-choice response format. We measured the percentage of accuracy, the reaction time (RT), and the confidence level (CL) in the perceived accuracy of the raters' responses. We found the highest MDS-UPDRS 3.2 scores in PD, and higher in AD than HCs. When evaluating the posed expression captures, raters identified a lower percentage of correct answers in the PD and AD groups than HCs. There was no difference in raters' response accuracy between the PD and AD. No difference was observed in RT and CL data between groups. Hypomimia in patients correlated positively with the global MDS-UPDRS-III and negatively with Mini Mental State Examination scores. PD and AD patients have a similar pattern of reduced facial emotion expressivity compared to controls. These findings hold potential pathophysiological and clinical implications.
