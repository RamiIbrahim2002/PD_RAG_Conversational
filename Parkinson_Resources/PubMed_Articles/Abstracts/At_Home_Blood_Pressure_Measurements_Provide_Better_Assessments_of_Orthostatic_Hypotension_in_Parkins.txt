Title: At-Home Blood Pressure Measurements Provide Better Assessments of Orthostatic Hypotension in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37763091

Abstract:
Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is common in Parkinson's Disease (PD). It is intermittent, exacerbated by stressors including meals, medications, and dehydration, and frequently is unrecognized. Although intermittent, assessment is usually by a single "in clinic" BP measurement. This study examines whether 10 home measurements are more sensitive in detecting OH than a single "in clinic" measurement. Participants (44 people with PD and 16 controls) were instructed to measure lying and standing BP at home. BP was measured on five consecutive days upon waking and before bedtime. Symptoms were also assessed using the Movement Disorder Society United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Non-Motor Questionnaire. While a postural drop in systolic BP (â‰¥20 mmHg) was recorded "in clinic" in thirteen of the forty-four PD participants, a postural drop was found in at least one of the ten home measurements in twenty-eight of the forty-four participants. Morning hypertension and variability in lying systolic BP was more common in these subjects than in those without a postural drop or the controls. A greater number of measurements of lying and standing BP are more likely to reveal orthostatic hypotension, variation in systolic BP, and hypertension than a single office measurement in people with PD.
