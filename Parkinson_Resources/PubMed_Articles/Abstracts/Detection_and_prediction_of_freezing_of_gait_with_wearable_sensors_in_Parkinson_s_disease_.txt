Title: Detection and prediction of freezing of gait with wearable sensors in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37843692

Abstract:
Freezing of gait (FoG) is one of the most distressing symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD), commonly occurring in patients at middle and late stages of the disease. Automatic and accurate FoG detection and prediction have emerged as a promising tool for long-term monitoring of PD and implementation of gait assistance systems. This paper reviews the recent development of FoG detection and prediction using wearable sensors, with attention on identifying knowledge gaps that need to be filled in future research. This review searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases to collect studies that detect or predict FoG with wearable sensors. After screening, 89 of 270 articles were included. The data description, extracted features, detection/prediction methods, and classification performance were extracted from the articles. As the number of papers of this area is increasing, the performance has been steadily improved. However, small datasets and inconsistent evaluation processes still hinder the application of FoG detection and prediction with wearable sensors in clinical practice.
