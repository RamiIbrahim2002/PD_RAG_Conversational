Title: Diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases with a refined Lempel-Ziv complexity.
PMID: 38826647

Abstract:
The investigation into the distinctive difference of gait is of significance for the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, human gait is affected by many factors like behavior, occupation and so on, and they may confuse the gait differences among Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. For the purpose of examining distinctive gait differences of neurodegenerative diseases, this study extracts various features from both vertical ground reaction force and time intervals. Moreover, refined Lempel-Ziv complexity is proposed considering the detailed distribution of signals based on the median and quartiles. Basic features (mean, coefficient of variance, and the asymmetry index), nonlinear dynamic features (Hurst exponent, correlation dimension, largest Lyapunov exponent), and refined Lempel-Ziv complexity of different neurodegenerative diseases are compared statistically by violin plot and Kruskal-Wallis test to reveal distinction and regularities. The comparative analysis results illustrate the gait differences across these neurodegenerative diseases by basic features and nonlinear dynamic features. Classification results by random forest indicate that the refined Lempel-Ziv complexity can robustly enhance the diagnosis accuracy when combined with basic features.
