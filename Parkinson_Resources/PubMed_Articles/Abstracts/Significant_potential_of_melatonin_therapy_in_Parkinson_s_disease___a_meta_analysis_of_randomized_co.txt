PMID: 37881313

Abstract:
Since its discovery as an antioxidant, melatonin has been increasingly recognized for its therapeutic potential beyond sleep disturbances in neurodegenerative disorders. This study aims to evaluate efficacy of various melatonin doses, treatment durations, and formulations, in alleviating motor symptoms and sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide.
