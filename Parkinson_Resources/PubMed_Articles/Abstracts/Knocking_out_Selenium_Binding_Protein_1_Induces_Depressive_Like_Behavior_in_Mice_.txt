Title: Knocking out Selenium Binding Protein 1 Induces Depressive-Like Behavior in Mice.
PMID: 37801218

Abstract:
Selenium binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) is involved in neurologic disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. However, the role of SELENBP1 in the neurogenesis of depression, which is a neurologic disorder, and the underlying mechanisms of oxidative stress and inflammation in depression remain unknown. In this study, we evaluated the changes in the expression levels of SELENBP1 in the hippocampus of a mouse model of depression and in the serum of human patients with depression using the Gene Expression Omnibus database. These changes were validated using blood samples from human patients with depression and mouse models with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive-like behavior. We also investigated the effects of SELENBP1 knockout (KO) on inflammation, oxidative stress, and hippocampal neurogenesis in mice with CUMS-induced depression. Our results revealed that SELENBP1 levels was decreased in the blood of human patients with depression and in the hippocampus of mice with CUMS-induced depression. SELENBP1 KO increased CUMS-induced depressive behavior in mice and caused dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. This led to a decrease in the numbers of doublecortin- and Ki67-positive cells, which might aggravate CUMS-induced depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that SELENBP1 might be involved in the regulation of neurogenesis in mice with depression and could be served as a potential target for diagnosing and treating depression.
