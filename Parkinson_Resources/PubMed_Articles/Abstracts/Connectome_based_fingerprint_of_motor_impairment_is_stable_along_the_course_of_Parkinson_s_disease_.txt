Title: Connectome-based fingerprint of motor impairment is stable along the course of Parkinson's disease.

Abstract:
Functional alterations in brain connectivity have previously been described in Parkinson's disease, but it is not clear whether individual differences in connectivity profiles might be also linked to severity of motor-symptom manifestation. Here we investigated the relevance of individual functional connectivity patterns measured with resting-state fMRI with respect to motor-symptom severity in Parkinson's disease, through a whole-brain, data-driven approach (connectome-based predictive modeling). Neuroimaging and clinical data of Parkinson's disease patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative were derived at baseline (session 1, n = 81) and at follow-up (session 2, n = 53). Connectome-based predictive modeling protocol was implemented to predict levels of motor impairment from individual connectivity profiles. The resulting predictive model comprised a network mainly involving functional connections between regions located in the cerebellum, and in the motor and frontoparietal networks. The predictive power of the model was stable along disease progression, as the connectivity within the same network could predict levels of motor impairment, even at a later stage of the disease. Finally, connectivity profiles within this network could be identified at the individual level, suggesting the presence of individual fingerprints within resting-state fMRI connectivity associated with motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease.
