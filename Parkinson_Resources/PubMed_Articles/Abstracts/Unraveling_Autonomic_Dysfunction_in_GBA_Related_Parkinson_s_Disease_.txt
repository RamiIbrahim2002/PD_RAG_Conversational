Title: Unraveling Autonomic Dysfunction in GBA-Related Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 38026514

Abstract:
Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and <i>GBA</i> gene mutations (GBA-PD) develop nonmotor complications more frequently than noncarriers. However, an objective characterization of both cardiovascular and sudomotor autonomic dysfunction using extensive clinical and instrumental measures has never been provided so far. Survival is reduced in GBA-PD regardless of age and dementia, suggesting that other hitherto unrecognized factors are involved.
