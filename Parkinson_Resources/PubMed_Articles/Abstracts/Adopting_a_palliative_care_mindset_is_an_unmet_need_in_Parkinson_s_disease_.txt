PMID: 37448833

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) affects multiple facets of patients' lives, many of which may not be recognized or addressed by their healthcare team. A growing body of evidence has shown that palliative care improves patients' quality of life with PD; however, little is currently known about how patients with PD perceive palliative care.
