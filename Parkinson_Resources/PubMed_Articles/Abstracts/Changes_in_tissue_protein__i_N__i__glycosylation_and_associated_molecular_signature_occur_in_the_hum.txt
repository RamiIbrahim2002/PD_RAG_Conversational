Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) associated state of neuroinflammation due to the aggregation of aberrant proteins is widely reported. One type of post-translational modification involved in protein stability is glycosylation. Here, we aimed to characterize the human Parkinsonian nigro-striatal <i>N</i>-glycome, and related transcriptome/proteome, and its correlation with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR), providing a comprehensive characterization of the PD molecular signature. Significant changes were seen upon a PD: a 3% increase in sialylation and 5% increase in fucosylation in both regions, and a 2% increase in oligomannosylated <i>N</i>-glycans in the substantia nigra. In the latter, a decrease in the mRNA expression of sialidases and an upregulation in the UPR pathway were also seen. To show the correlation between these, we also describe a small in vitro study where changes in specific glycosylation trait enzymes (inhibition of sialyltransferases) led to impairments in cell mitochondrial activity, changes in glyco-profile, and upregulation in UPR pathways. This complete characterization of the human nigro-striatal <i>N</i>-glycome provides an insight into the glycomic profile of PD through a transversal approach while combining the other PD "omics" pieces, which can potentially assist in the development of glyco-focused therapeutics.
