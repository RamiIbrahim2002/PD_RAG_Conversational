Title: MicroRNAs-Based Theranostics against Anesthetic-Induced Neurotoxicity.
PMID: 37514018

Abstract:
Various clinical reports indicate prolonged exposure to general anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity (in vitro and in vivo). Behavior changes (memory and cognition) are compilations commonly cited with general anesthetics. The ability of miRNAs to modulate gene expression, thereby selectively altering cellular functions, remains one of the emerging techniques in the recent decade. Importantly, engineered miRNAs (which are of the two categories, i.e., agomir and antagomir) to an extent found to mitigate neurotoxicity. Utilizing pre-designed synthetic miRNA oligos would be an ideal analeptic approach for intervention based on indicative parameters. This review demonstrates engineered miRNA's potential as prophylactics and/or therapeutics minimizing the general anesthetics-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we share our thoughts regarding the current challenges and feasibility of using miRNAs as therapeutic agents to counteract the adverse neurological effects. Moreover, we discuss the scientific status and updates on the novel neuro-miRNAs related to therapy against neurotoxicity induced by amyloid beta (AÎ²) and Parkinson's disease (PD).
