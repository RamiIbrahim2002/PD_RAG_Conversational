Title: Prevalence and severity of freezing of gait in a Danish cohort of people with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38018704

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a widespread neurodegenerative disorder characterised by wide range of symptoms. Freezing of gait (FoG), a transient feeling that the patient's feet are nailed to the floor, resulting in an inability to move, is a particularly distressful symptom. The assessment of FoG can be challenging. Often, clinicians are reliant on patients' subjective experiences and patient questionnaires such as the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ) and its updated version, the New FOGQ (NFOGQ).Until now, the NFOGQ has not been validated and piloted for use in Danish. Therefore, few attempts have been made to assess the prevalence and severity of FoG in Danish patients with PD.
