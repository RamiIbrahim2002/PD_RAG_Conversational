Title: Carpets with visual cues can improve gait in Parkinson's disease patients: may be independent of executive function.
PMID: 37974270

Abstract:
Gait impairment is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, which greatly reduces their quality of life. Executive dysfunction is associated with gait impairment. Compensatory strategies, including visual cues, have been shown to be effective in improving PD gait. In this study, we aimed to understand whether carpets with visual cues could improve PD gait, and how the improvement varies across patients with different executive function state.
