Abstract:
A study was conducted to investigate the effects of different doses of 6-hydroxy-2,2,4-trimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (HTHQ) on motor coordination scores, brain tissue morphology, the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, the severity of oxidative stress parameters, the levels of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) factor, and the inflammatory response in rats during the development of rotenone-induced Parkinsonism. The findings indicate that HTHQ, with its antioxidant attributes, reduced the levels of 8-isoprostane, lipid oxidation products, and protein oxidation products. The decrease in oxidative stress due to HTHQ led to a reduction in the mRNA content of proinflammatory cytokines and myeloperoxidase activity, accompanying the drop in the expression of the factor NF-κB. These alterations promoted an improvement in motor coordination scores and increased tyrosine hydroxylase levels, whereas histopathological changes in the brain tissue of the experimental animals were attenuated. HTHQ exhibited greater effectiveness than the comparative drug rasagiline based on the majority of variables.
