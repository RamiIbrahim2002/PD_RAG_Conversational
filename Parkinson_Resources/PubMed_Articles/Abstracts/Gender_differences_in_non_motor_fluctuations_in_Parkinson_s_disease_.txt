Title: Gender differences in non-motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37526768

Abstract:
Non-motor symptoms (NMS) and Non-motor fluctuations (NMF) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) are common, involving several domains and affecting quality of life. Aim of the study is to estimate the burden of NMF in PD patients and to evaluate the possible gender effect. PD patients fulfilling the MDS-PD diagnostic criteria attending the "Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Centre" of the University of Catania were evaluated using the Non-Motor Fluctuations Assessment (NoMoFA) Questionnaire. NoMoFA items were also grouped into the following domains: cognitive, mood, sleep/fatigue, dysautonomia, hallucination/perception and miscellaneous domains were identified. One-hundred and twenty-one patients with PD (67 men, 55.4%; mean age 70.2 ± 8.9 years, disease duration 8.3 ± 4.6 years) were evaluated. All PD patients reported at least one NMS, whereas 87 (71.9%) also reported NMF. "Feel sluggish or had low energy levels" (47.2%) along with "Feel excessively sleepy during the day" (40.0%) were the most common NMF reported in the whole sample. The majority of PD patients reported the presence of NMF during the OFF state (79, 65.3%). At multivariate analysis, NMF were positively associated with the female gender (adjusted OR 3.13; 95%CI 1.21-8.11 p-value 0.01). Women with PD had higher NMF scores especially in depression/anxiety, sleep/fatigue and dysautonomia domains. Our study reported the presence of a gender-related pattern in the frequency of NMS and NMF in PD patients, with female gender associated with a higher risk of developing NMF, highlighting the need for personalized treatment strategies when addressing NMF.
