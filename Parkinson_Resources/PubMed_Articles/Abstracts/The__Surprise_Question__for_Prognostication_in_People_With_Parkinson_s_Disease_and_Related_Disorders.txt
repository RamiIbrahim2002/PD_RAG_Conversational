Title: The "Surprise Question" for Prognostication in People With Parkinson's Disease and Related Disorders.
PMID: 37838080

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease and related disorders (PDRD) are fatal neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a fluctuating course that can complicate prognostication. The "surprise question" (SQ: "Would you be surprised if your patient died in the next year?") has been used to identify patients with limited prognosis but has not been assessed in PDRD.
