Title: Communicative participation outcomes in individuals with Parkinson's disease receiving standard care speech-language therapy services in community settings.
PMID: 37855252

Abstract:
The Communicative Participation Item Bank (CPIB) is a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) designed to measure the extent of interference, or difficulty, experienced by adults with communication disorders participating in their day-to-day communication activities. To date, there is limited evidence regarding sensitivity of the CPIB for capturing change with intervention in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD).
