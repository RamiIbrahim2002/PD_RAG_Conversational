PMID: 37505124

Abstract:
Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, which has impacts on the patient's quality of life due to non-motor symptoms such as sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gained increasing attention in the diagnosis and treatment of PD with the concept of "overall concepts and dialectical treatment." Therefore, exploring the characteristics of TCM in the treatment of PD can improve the level of diagnosis and treatment of PD.
