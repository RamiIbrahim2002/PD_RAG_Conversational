Title: Effects of training involving patterned sensory enhancement on improving upper-limb movements in patients with Parkinson's disease: protocol of a randomised controlled trial.
PMID: 37438071

Abstract:
Bradykinesia (ie, slow movements) is one of the most prominent symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and has a negative impact on quality of life. Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS), a widely used and promising treatment technique, has been shown to effectively improve gait speed in patients with PD. The upper-limb movements, which also suffer from bradykinesia, are essential for daily life and directly impact quality of life. The term, patterned sensory enhancement (PSE) instead of RAS, is used when movement training targets the human body except lower limbs. Up until now, scarce studies have explored effects of training involving PSE on upper-limb movements. The purpose of this study is to investigate effects of movement training involving PSE on upper-limb movement speed and function in patients with PD.
