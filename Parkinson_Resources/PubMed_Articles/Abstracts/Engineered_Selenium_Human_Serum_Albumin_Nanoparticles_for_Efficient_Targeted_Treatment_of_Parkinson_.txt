Title: Engineered Selenium/Human Serum Albumin Nanoparticles for Efficient Targeted Treatment of Parkinson's Disease via Oral Gavage.
PMID: 37807265

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the midbrain substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). While existing therapeutic strategies can alleviate PD symptoms, they cannot inhibit DA neuron loss. Herein, a tailor-made human serum albumin (HSA)-based selenium nanosystem (HSA/Se nanoparticles, HSA/Se NPs) to treat PD that can overcome the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) is described. HSA, a transporter for drug delivery, has superior biological characteristics that make it an ideal potential drug delivery substance. Findings reveal that HSA/Se NPs have lower toxicity and higher efficacy than other selenium species and the ability to overcome the IEB and BBB to enrich DA neurons, which then protect MN9D cells from MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced neurotoxicity and ameliorate both behavioral deficits and DA neuronal death in MPTP-model mice. Thus, a therapeutic drug delivery system composed of orally gavaged HSA/Se NPs for the treatment of PD is described.
