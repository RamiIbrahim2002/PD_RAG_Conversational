PMID: 38033932

Abstract:
Chronic constipation is a common condition affecting people of all ages; therefore, the socioeconomic burden of chronic constipation is nonnegligible. Elobixibat (ELO), an ileal bail acid transport inhibitor, was launched in Japan in 2018. However, evidence of its use in diverse populations is limited.
