Title: Active ingredients of Chinese medicine with immunomodulatory properties: NF-κB pathway and Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37748570

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a complex pathogenesis and no cure. Persistent neuroinflammation plays an important role in the development of PD, and activation of microglia and astrocytes within the central nervous system leads to an inflammatory response and production of pro-inflammatory factors, and activation of NF-κB is key to neuroglial activation in chronic inflammation in PD and a hallmark of the onset of neuroinflammatory disease. Therefore, inhibiting NF-κB activation to prevent further loss of dopaminergic nerves is a more effective means of treating PD. It has been found that an increasing number of active ingredients in Chinese medicines, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, terpenoids, phenols and phenylpropanoids, have anti-inflammatory properties that can regulate neuroglia cell activation and ameliorate neuroinflammation through the NF-κB pathway, and increase dopamine release or protect dopaminergic neurons for neuroprotection to improve behavioural dysfunction in PD. The active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine are expected to be good candidates for the treatment of PD, as they provide holistic regulation through multi-targeting and multi-level effects, and are safe, inexpensive and readily available. Therefore, this paper summarises that the active ingredients of some relevant Chinese medicines ameliorate the symptoms of PD and delay the development of PD by inhibiting glial cell-mediated neuroinflammation through the NF-κB pathway, which may provide new ideas for exploring the molecular mechanism of PD pathogenesis and developing new anti-PD drugs.
