Title: Mesenchymal stromal cell biotherapy for Parkinson's disease premotor symptoms.
PMID: 37833807

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with motor deficits due to nigrostriatal dopamine depletion and with the non-motor/premotor symptoms (NMS) such as anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, depression, hyposmia, and sleep disorders. NMS is presented in at least one-fifth of the patients with PD. With the histological information being investigated, stem cells are shown to provide neurotrophic supports and cellular replacement in the damaging brain areas under PD conditions. Pathological change of progressive PD includes degeneration and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. The current stem cell beneficial effect addresses dopamine boost for the striatal neurons and gliovascular mechanisms as competing for validated PD drug targets. In addition, there are clinical interventions for improving the patient's NMS and targeting their autonomic dysfunction, dementia, mood disorders, or sleep problems. In our and many others' research using brain injury models, multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells demonstrate an additional and unique ability to alleviate depressive-like behaviors, independent of an accelerated motor recovery. Intranasal delivery of the stem cells is discussed for it is extensively tested in rodent animal models of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we attempt to discuss the repairing potentials of transplanted cells into parkinsonism pathological regions of motor deficits and focus on preventive and treatment effects. From new approaches in the PD biological therapy, it is believed that it can as well benefit patients against PD-NMS.
