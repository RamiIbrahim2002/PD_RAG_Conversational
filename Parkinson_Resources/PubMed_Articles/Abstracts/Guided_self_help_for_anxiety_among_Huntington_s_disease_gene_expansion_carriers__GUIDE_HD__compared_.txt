Title: Guided self-help for anxiety among Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers (GUIDE-HD) compared to treatment as usual: a randomised controlled feasibility trial.
PMID: 37700320

Abstract:
Huntington's disease (HD) is an adult-onset genetic neurodegenerative conditionÂ associated with cognitive decline, motor impairments, and emotional difficulties. Anxiety affects up to 71% of HD gene expansion carriers (i.e., those with the version of the gene that causes HD) and can negatively impact quality of life, worsen other HD symptoms, and increase suicide risk. Therefore, helping people with their anxiety should be a clinical priority. A significant evidence base now exists for low-cost talking therapies for anxiety, such as guided self-help, and with people with other neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., Parkinson's disease). However, this type of intervention has not been specifically assessed with HD gene expansion carriers.
