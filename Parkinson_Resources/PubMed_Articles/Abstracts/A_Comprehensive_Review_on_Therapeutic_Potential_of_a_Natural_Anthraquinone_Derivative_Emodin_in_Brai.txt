PMID: 37594103

Abstract:
Brain-related disorders are one of the world's most important and complex health problems today. These brain-related disorders are responsible for a massive number of morbidities and death all around the world. However, researchers have devoted a large amount of time to investigating these diseases and found positive results; nevertheless, there are currently quite a few medications available to treat them. Emodin (EM), a polyphenol compound, has many health benefits. It is a biologically active monomer derived from rhubarb root that exhibits anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anticancer, and neuroprotective properties. A series of preclinical trials have shown EM to have protective benefits against many brain-related diseases. This review has evaluated the potential of EM as a pharmacological agent for the treatment and management of various brain-related disorders based on the findings of multiple pre-clinical studies and taking into account the compound's therapeutic properties.
