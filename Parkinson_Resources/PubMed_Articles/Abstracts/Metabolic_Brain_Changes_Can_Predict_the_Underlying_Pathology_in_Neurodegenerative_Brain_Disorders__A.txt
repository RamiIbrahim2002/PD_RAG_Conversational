Abstract:
The co-occurrence of multiple proteinopathies is being increasingly recognized in neurodegenerative disorders and poses a challenge in differential diagnosis and patient selection for clinical trials. Changes in brain metabolism captured by positron emission tomography (PET) with <sup>18</sup> F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) allow us to differentiate between different neurodegenerative disorders either by visual exploration or by studying disease-specific metabolic networks in individual patients. However, the impact of multiple proteinopathies on brain metabolism and metabolic networks remains unknown due to the absence of pathological studies. In this case study, we present a 67-year-old patient with rapidly progressing dementia clinically diagnosed with probable sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). However, in addition to the expected pronounced cortical and subcortical hypometabolism characteristic of sCJD, the brain FDG PET revealed an intriguing finding of unexpected relative hypermetabolism in the bilateral putamina, raising suspicions of coexisting Parkinson's disease (PD). Additional investigation of disease-specific metabolic brain networks revealed elevated expression of both CJD-related pattern (CJDRP) and PD-related pattern (PDRP) networks. The patient eventually developed akinetic mutism and passed away seven weeks after symptom onset. Neuropathological examination confirmed neuropathological changes consistent with sCJD and the presence of Lewy bodies confirming PD pathology. Additionally, hyperphosphorylated tau and TDP-43 pathology were observed, a combination of four proteinopathies that had not been previously reported. Overall, this case provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of neurodegenerative pathologies and their impact on metabolic brain changes, emphasizing the role of metabolic brain imaging in evaluating potential presence of multiple proteinopathies.
