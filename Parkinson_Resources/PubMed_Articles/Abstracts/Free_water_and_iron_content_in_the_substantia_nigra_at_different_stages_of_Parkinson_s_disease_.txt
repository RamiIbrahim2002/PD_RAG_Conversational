Title: Free water and iron content in the substantia nigra at different stages of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37579561

Abstract:
Abnormalities in free water (FW) and susceptibility values exist in the substantia nigra (SN) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but their role in characterizing the disease processes remains uncertain. This study investigated these values at various SN locations and stages of PD, and their relationship with clinical symptoms.
