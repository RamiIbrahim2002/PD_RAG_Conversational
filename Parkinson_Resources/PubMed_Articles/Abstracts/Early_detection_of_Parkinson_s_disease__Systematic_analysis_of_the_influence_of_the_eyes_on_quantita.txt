Title: Early detection of Parkinson's disease: Systematic analysis of the influence of the eyes on quantitative biomarkers in resting state electroencephalography.
PMID: 37829809

Abstract:
While resting state electroencephalography (EEG) provides relevant information on pathological changes in Parkinson's disease, most studies focus on the eyes-closed EEG biomarkers. Recent evidence has shown that both eyes-open EEG and reactivity to eyes-opening can also differentiate Parkinson's disease from healthy aging, but no consensus has been reached on a discriminatory capability benchmark. The aim of this study was to determine the resting-state EEG biomarkers suitable for real-time application that can differentiate Parkinson's patients from healthy subjects under both eyes closed and open. For this, we analysed and compared the quantitative EEG analyses of 13 early-stage cognitively normal Parkinson's patients with an age and sex-matched healthy group. We found that Parkinson's disease exhibited abnormal excessive theta activity in eyes-closed, which was reflected by a significantly higher relative theta power, a higher time percentage with a frequency peak in the theta band and a reduced alpha/theta ratio, while Parkinson's patients showed a significantly steeper non-oscillatory spectral slope activity than that of healthy subjects. We also found considerably less alpha and beta reactivity to eyes-opening in Parkinson's disease plus a significant moderate correlation between these EEG-biomarkers and the MDS-UPDRS score, used to assesses the clinical symptoms of Parkinson's Disease. Both EEG recordings with the eyes open and reactivity to eyes-opening provided additional information to the eyes-closed condition. We thus strongly recommend that both eyes open and closed be used in clinical practice recording protocols to promote EEG as a complementary non-invasive screening method for the early detection of Parkinson's disease, which would allow clinicians to design patient-oriented treatment and improve the patient's quality of life.
