Title: Neural effects of deep brain stimulation on reward and loss anticipation and food viewing in anorexia nervosa: a pilot study.
PMID: 37605212

Abstract:
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe and life-threatening psychiatric disorder. Initial studies on deep brain stimulation (DBS) in severe, treatment-refractory AN have shown clinical effects. However, the working mechanisms of DBS in AN remain largely unknown. Here, we used a task-based functional MRI approach to understand the pathophysiology of AN.
