Title: Desynchronization of neuronal firing in multiparameter ultrasound stimulation.
PMID: 37820600

Abstract:
Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation, a novel neuromodulation technique, that possesses the advantages of non-invasiveness, high penetration depth, and high spatial resolution, has achieved positive neuromodulation effects in animal studies. But the regulatory mechanism remains controversial. The intramembrane cavitation effect is considered one of the mechanisms for ultrasound neuromodulation. In this study, the modified equations of ultrasonic cavitation bubble dynamics were coupled with the dual-coupled neuron Hindmarsh-Rose model, small-world neural network model, and the Jansen-Rit neural mass model, which simulate simple coupled neurons, complex neuronal networks, and discharge signals in epileptic disorders respectively. The results demonstrated that ultrasound stimulation has an appreciable modulatory effect on neuronal firing desynchronization in Hindmarsh-Rose model and small-world neural network model. The desynchronization effect is related to the stimulation frequency and intensity. Furthermore, ultrasound stimulation has an inhibitory effect on epileptic seizures, and the effect is enhanced by increasing ultrasound frequency from 0.1-1.0 MHz. This is the first combination of ultrasonic intramembrane cavitation effect theory with neurons and neural network firing desynchronization, which can provide guidance of parametric and theories support for the studies of neurological diseases such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease.
