Title: Autonomic function and motor subtypes in Parkinson's disease: a multicentre cross-sectional study.
PMID: 37666916

Abstract:
Autonomic symptoms (AS) are critical in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to determine the relative significance of clinical factors allowing predictions about incidence of AS, and examine AS profiles among PD patients by motor subtype and its relation to AS. The cross-sectional data of a multicentre sample, including 714 PD patients and 194 healthy controls from Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative study and Pingchan granule study were analyzed, stratified by PD subtypes [postural instability and gait disturbances (PIGD), tremor dominant (TD), and indeterminate] and domain autonomic dysfunction. Compared with healthy controls, PD patients scored higher in the total Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic dysfunction score and in several domain scores in particular, and there was a significant overlap in domain AS. Risk factors of individual domain autonomic dysfunction were heterogeneous. PIGD and indeterminate were the predominant subtypes in pupillomotor and thermoregulatory symptoms. TD and indeterminate were more likely to suffer from cardiovascular problem. The odd in sexual dysfunction was significant for PIGD. Gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms seemed not to be associated with a specific subtype. Our study demonstrated that AS were highly heterogeneous and 3 subtypes differed in autonomic performance, providing clues to understand mechanisms underlying AS in PD.
