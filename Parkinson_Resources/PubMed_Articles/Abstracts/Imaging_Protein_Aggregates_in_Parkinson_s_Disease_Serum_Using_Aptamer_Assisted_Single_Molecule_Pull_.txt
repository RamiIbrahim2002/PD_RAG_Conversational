Title: Imaging Protein Aggregates in Parkinson's Disease Serum Using Aptamer-Assisted Single-Molecule Pull-Down.
PMID: 37782556

Abstract:
The formation of soluble α-synuclein (α-syn) and amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates is associated with the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Current methods mainly focus on the measurement of the aggregate concentration and are unable to determine their heterogeneous size and shape, which potentially also change during the development of PD due to increased protein aggregation. In this work, we introduce aptamer-assisted single-molecule pull-down (APSiMPull) combined with super-resolution fluorescence imaging of α-syn and Aβ aggregates in human serum from early PD patients and age-matched controls. Our diffraction-limited imaging results indicate that the proportion of α-syn aggregates (α-syn/(α-syn+Aβ)) can be used to distinguish PD and control groups with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85. Further, super resolution fluorescence imaging reveals that PD serums have a higher portion of larger and rounder α-syn aggregates than controls. Little difference was observed for Aβ aggregates. Combining these two metrics, we constructed a new biomarker and achieved an AUC of 0.90. The combination of the aggregate number and morphology provides a new approach to early PD diagnosis.
