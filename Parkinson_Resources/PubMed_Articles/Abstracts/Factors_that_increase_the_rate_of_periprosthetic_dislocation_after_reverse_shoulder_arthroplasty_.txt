Title: Factors that increase the rate of periprosthetic dislocation after reverse shoulder arthroplasty.
PMID: 38041138

Abstract:
Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is considered one of the greatest technological innovations in shoulder reconstruction surgery, as evidenced by the fact its growth rate of usage is greatest among all shoulder arthroplasties. However, like all arthroplasties, a post-surgical complication often arises. One of these complications, periprosthetic dislocation (PPD), requires revision and poses, therefore, a burden on both patients and healthcare providers. While PPD is understood to be a complication of RSA, it is unclear to what extent certain risk factors and co-morbidities predispose patients to post-RSA PPD. The purpose of this study was to identify and evaluate the impact of specific risk factors and co-morbidities that contribute to the development of PPD following RSA.
