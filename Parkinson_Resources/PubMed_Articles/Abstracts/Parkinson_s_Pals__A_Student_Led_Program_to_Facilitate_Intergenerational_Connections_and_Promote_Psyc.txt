PMID: 37742662

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) causes unique motor and non-motor symptoms. Despite symptomatic treatment with pharmacotherapies, many persons with PD report feelings of loneliness and demoralization as their disease progresses. These symptoms greatly interfere with quality of life, necessitating novel treatment strategies. In this report, we introduce a new student-led program to improve psychosocial well-being among persons with PD by pairing them with college students. Through weekly one-on-one meetings, students gain a deeper understanding of PD, while patients gain a new social outlet and purpose. Based on the program's initial successes, we advocate for the adoption of similar programs at universities worldwide.
