Title: Abnormal eye movements in Parkinson's disease: From experimental study to clinical application.
PMID: 37537120

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that integrates a series of motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms, making early recognition challenging. The exploration of biomarkers is urgently required. Abnormal eye movements in PD have been reported to appear in a variety of ways since eye tracking technology was developed, such as decreased saccade amplitude, extended saccade latency, and unique saccade patterns. Non-invasive, objective and simple eye tracking has the potential to provide effective biomarkers for the PD diagnosis, progression and cognitive impairment, as well as ideas for research into the occurrence and treatment strategy of motor symptoms. In this review, we introduced the fundamental eye movement patterns and typical eye movement paradigms (such as fixation, pro-saccade, anti-saccade, smooth tracking, and visual search), summarized the symptoms of various ocular motor abnormalities in PD, and discussed the research implications of oculomotor investigation to the pathogenesis of PD and related motor symptoms, as well as the clinical implications as biomarkers and its inspiration on treatment.
