Title: Discovery and Characterization of Novel CNS-Penetrant GPR55 Agonists.
PMID: 37708305

Abstract:
From our NETSseq-derived human brain transcriptomics data, we identified GPR55 as a potential molecular target for the treatment of motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. From a high-throughput screen, we identified and optimized agonists with nanomolar potency against both human and rat GPR55. We discovered compounds with either strong or limited Î²-arrestin signaling and receptor desensitization, indicating biased signaling. A compound that showed minimal GPR55 desensitization demonstrated a reduction in firing frequency of medium spiny neurons cultured from rat striatum but did not reverse motor deficits in a rat hypolocomotion model. Further profiling of several desensitizing and non-desensitizing lead compounds showed that they are selective over related cannabinoid receptors CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> and that unbound brain concentrations well above the respective GPR55 EC<sub>50</sub> can be readily achieved following oral administration. The novel brain-penetrant GPR55 agonists disclosed can be used to probe the role of this receptor in the brain.
