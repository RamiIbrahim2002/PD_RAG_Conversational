Abstract:
The presence of deposits of alpha-synuclein (αS) fibrils in the cells of the brain is a hallmark of several α-synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease. As most disease cases are not familial, it is likely that external factors play a role in the disease onset. One of the external factors that may influence the disease onset is viral infection. It has recently been shown in <i>in vitro</i> assays that in the presence of SARS-Cov-2 N-protein, αS fibril formation is faster and proceeds in an unusual two-step aggregation process. Here, we show that faster fibril formation is not due to the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein-catalysed formation of an aggregation-prone nucleus. Instead, aggregation starts with the formation of a population of mixed αS/N-protein fibrils with low affinity for αS. Mixed amyloid fibrils, composed of two different proteins, have not been observed before. After the depletion of N-protein, fibril formation comes to a halt, until a slow transformation into fibrils with characteristics of a pure αS fibril strain occurs. This transformation into a strain of αS fibrils subsequently results in a second phase of fibril growth until a new equilibrium is reached. We hypothesize that this fibril strain transformation may be of relevance in the cell-to-cell spread of the αS pathology and disease onset.
