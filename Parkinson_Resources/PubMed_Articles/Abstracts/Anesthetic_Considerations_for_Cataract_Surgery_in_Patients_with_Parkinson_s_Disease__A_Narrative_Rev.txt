PMID: 38021330

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurological degenerative disease affecting the central nervous system, which is responsible for progressive disorders such as slow movements, tremors, rigidity, and cognitive disorders. There are no specific recommendations and guidelines for anesthetic management of patients with PD undergoing ophthalmic procedures. This narrative review aims to summarise the anesthetic considerations in patients with PD presenting for cataract surgery.
