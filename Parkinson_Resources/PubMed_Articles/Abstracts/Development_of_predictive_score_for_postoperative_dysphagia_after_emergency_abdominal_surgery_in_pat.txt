Title: Development of predictive score for postoperative dysphagia after emergency abdominal surgery in patients of advanced age.
PMID: 38250679

Abstract:
Postoperative dysphagia after emergency abdominal surgery (EAS) in patients of advanced age has become problematic, and appropriate dysphagia management is needed. This study was performed to identify predictive factors of dysphagia after EAS and to explore the usefulness of swallowing screening tools (SSTs).
