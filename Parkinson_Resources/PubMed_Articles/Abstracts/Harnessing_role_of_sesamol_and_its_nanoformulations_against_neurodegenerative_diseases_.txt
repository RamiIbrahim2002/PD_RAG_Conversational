Title: Harnessing role of sesamol and its nanoformulations against neurodegenerative diseases.
PMID: 37725878

Abstract:
Sesamol is a lignan of sesame seeds and a natural phenolic molecule that has emerged as a useful medical agent. Sesamol is a non-toxic phytoconstituent, which exerts certain valuable effects in the management of cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), etc. Sesamol is known to depict its neuroprotective role by various mechanisms, such as metabolic regulators, action on oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, etc. However, its poor oral bioavailability, rapid excretion (as conjugates), and susceptibility to gastric irritation/toxicity (particularly in rats' forestomach) may restrict its effectiveness. To overcome the associated limitations, novel drug delivery system-based formulations of sesamol are emerging and being researched extensively. These can conjugate with sesamol and enhance the bioavailability and solubility of free sesamol, along with delivery at the target site. In this review, we have summarized various research works highlighting the role of sesamol on various NDs, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the formulation strategies and neuroprotective role of sesamol-based nano-formulations have also been discussed.
