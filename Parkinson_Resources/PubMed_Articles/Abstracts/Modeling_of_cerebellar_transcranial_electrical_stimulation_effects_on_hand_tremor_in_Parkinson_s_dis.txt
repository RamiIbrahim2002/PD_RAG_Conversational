Title: Modeling of cerebellar transcranial electrical stimulation effects on hand tremor in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38020756

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with different motor and neurocognitive symptoms. Tremor is a well-known symptom of this disease. Increasing evidence suggested that the cerebellum may substantially contribute to tremors as a clinical symptom of PD. However, the theoretical foundations behind these observations are not yet fully understood.
