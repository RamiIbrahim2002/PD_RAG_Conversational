PMID: 37653795

Abstract:
Paroxetine therapy has been used for treatment of patients with depression and Parkinson's disease (dPD) in many clinical studies, but, the effects of paroxetine in dPD patients are not completely understood. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the effects of paroxetine therapy on depressive symptom and motor function in the treatment of dPD, in order to confer a reference for clinical practice.
