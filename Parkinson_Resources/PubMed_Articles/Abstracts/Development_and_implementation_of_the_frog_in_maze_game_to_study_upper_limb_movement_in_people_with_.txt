Title: Development and implementation of the frog-in-maze game to study upper limb movement in people with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38123606

Abstract:
Upper-limb bradykinesia occurs early in Parkinson's disease (PD) and bradykinesia is required for diagnosis. Our goal was to develop, implement and validate a game "walking" a frog through a maze using bimanual, alternating finger-tapping movements to provide a salient, objective, and remotely monitorable method of tracking disease progression and response to therapy in PD. Twenty-five people with PD and 16 people without PD participated. Responses on 5 different mazes were quantified and compared to spatiotemporal gait parameters and standard disease metrics in these participants. Intertap interval (ITI) on maze 2 & 3, which included turns, was strongly inversely related to stride-length and stride-velocity and directly related to motor UPDRS scores. Levodopa decreased ITI, except in maze 4. PD participants with freezing of gait had longer ITI on all mazes. The responses quantified on maze 2 & 3 were related to disease severity and gait stride-length, were levodopa responsive, and were worse in people with freezing of gait, suggesting that these mazes could be used to quantify motor dysfunction in PD. Programming our frog-in-maze game onto a remotely distributable platform could provide a tool to monitor disease progression and therapeutic response in people with PD, including during clinical trials.
