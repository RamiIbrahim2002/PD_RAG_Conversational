Title: Neuropharmacological potential of honokiol and its derivatives from Chinese herb Magnolia species: understandings from therapeutic viewpoint.
PMID: 38001538

Abstract:
Honokiol is a neolignan biphenol found in aerial parts of the Magnolia plant species. The Magnolia plant species traditionally belong to China and have been used for centuries to treat many pathological conditions. Honokiol mitigates the severity of several pathological conditions and has the potential to work as an anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, anticancer, antioxidant, and neurotherapeutic agent. It has a long history of being employed in the healthcare practices of Southeast Asia, but in recent years, a greater scope of research has been conducted on it. Plenty of experimental evidence suggests it could be beneficial as a neuroprotective bioactive molecule. Honokiol has several pharmacological effects, leading to its exploration as a potential therapy for neurological diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), cerebral ischemia, anxiety, depression, spinal cord injury, and so on. So, based on the previous experimentation reports, our goal is to discuss the neuroprotective properties of honokiol. Besides, honokiol derivatives have been highlighted recently as possible therapeutic options for NDs. So, this review focuses on honokiol's neurotherapeutic actions and toxicological profile to determine their safety and potential use in neurotherapeutics.
