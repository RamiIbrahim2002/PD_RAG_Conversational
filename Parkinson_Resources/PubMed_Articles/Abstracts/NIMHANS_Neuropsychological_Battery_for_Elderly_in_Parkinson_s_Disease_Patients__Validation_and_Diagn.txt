PMID: 37538425

Abstract:
Cognitive impairment is a common non-motor feature of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment is challenging and routinely missed in clinical practice. Our study aimed to study the efficacy of NIMHANS Neuropsychological Battery for Elderly (NNB-E) in diagnosing subtle cognitive deficits in PD patients.
