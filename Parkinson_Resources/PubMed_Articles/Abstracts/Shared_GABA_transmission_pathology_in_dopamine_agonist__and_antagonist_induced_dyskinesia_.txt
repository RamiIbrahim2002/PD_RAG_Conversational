Title: Shared GABA transmission pathology in dopamine agonist- and antagonist-induced dyskinesia.
PMID: 37774703

Abstract:
Dyskinesia is involuntary movement caused by long-term medication with dopamine-related agents: the dopamine agonist 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) to treat Parkinson's disease (L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia [LID]) or dopamine antagonists to treat schizophrenia (tardive dyskinesia [TD]). However, it remains unknown why distinct types of medications for distinct neuropsychiatric disorders induce similar involuntary movements. Here, we search for a shared structural footprint using magnetic resonance imaging-based macroscopic screening and super-resolution microscopy-based microscopic identification. We identify the enlarged axon terminals of striatal medium spiny neurons in LID and TD model mice. Striatal overexpression of the vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter (VGAT) is necessary and sufficient for modeling these structural changes; VGAT levels gate the functional and behavioral alterations in dyskinesia models. Our findings indicate that lowered type 2 dopamine receptor signaling with repetitive dopamine fluctuations is a common cause of VGAT overexpression and late-onset dyskinesia formation and that reducing dopamine fluctuation rescues dyskinesia pathology via VGAT downregulation.
