Title: Social Control and Health Behaviors Among Individuals Living with Parkinson's Disease: A Pilot Study.
PMID: 37783869

Abstract:
Positive health behaviors (e.g., exercise, healthy eating habits, good sleep hygiene, treatment adherence) are important in ensuring optimal symptom management and health outcomes among individuals living with Parkinson's disease (PD). While multiple factors may influence engagement in health behaviors, little is known about the occurrence of social control, or relationship partners' attempts to influence and regulate another's behavior, and its potential role in the adoption of health behaviors among individuals with PD.
