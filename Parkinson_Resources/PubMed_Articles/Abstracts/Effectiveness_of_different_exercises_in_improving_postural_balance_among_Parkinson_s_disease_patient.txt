PMID: 37529009

Abstract:
Exercise has been reported as an effective intervention for Parkinson's disease. However, there is still debate on the what kinds of exercises prior to choosing. This study aimed to compare and rank the different exercises that effectively enhance postural balance in Parkinson's disease patients by quantifying the information gleaned from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
