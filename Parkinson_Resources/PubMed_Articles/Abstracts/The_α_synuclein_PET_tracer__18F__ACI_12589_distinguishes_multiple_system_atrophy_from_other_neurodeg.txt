Abstract:
A positron emission tomography (PET) tracer detecting α-synuclein pathology will improve the diagnosis, and ultimately the treatment of α-synuclein-related diseases. Here we show that the PET ligand, [<sup>18</sup>F]ACI-12589, displays good in vitro affinity and specificity for pathological α-synuclein in tissues from patients with different α-synuclein-related disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Multiple-System Atrophy (MSA) using autoradiography and radiobinding techniques. In the initial clinical evaluation we include 23 participants with α-synuclein related disorders, 11 with other neurodegenerative disorders and eight controls. In vivo [<sup>18</sup>F]ACI-12589 demonstrates clear binding in the cerebellar white matter and middle cerebellar peduncles of MSA patients, regions known to be highly affected by α-synuclein pathology, but shows limited binding in PD. The binding statistically separates MSA patients from healthy controls and subjects with other neurodegenerative disorders, including other synucleinopathies. Our results indicate that α-synuclein pathology in MSA can be identified using [<sup>18</sup>F]ACI-12589 PET imaging, potentially improving the diagnostic work-up of MSA and allowing for detection of drug target engagement in vivo of novel α-synuclein targeting therapies.
