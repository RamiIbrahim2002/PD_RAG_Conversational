Title: The Neuroprotective Effect of Isotetrandrine on Parkinson's Disease via Anti-Inflammation and Antiapoptosis <i>In Vitro</i> and <i>In Vivo</i>.
PMID: 37854894

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most influential diseases in the world, and the current medication only can relieve the clinical symptoms but not slow the progression of PD. Therefore, we intend to examine the neuroprotective activity of plant-derived compound isotetrandrine (ITD) <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo. In vitro</i>, cells were cotreated with ITD and LPS to detect the inflammatory-related protein and mRNA. <i>In vivo</i>, zebrafish were pretreated with ITD and inhibitors prior to 6-OHDA treatment. Then, the behavior was monitored at 5 dpf. Our result showed ITD inhibited LPS-induced upregulation of iNOS, COX-2 protein expression, and iL-6, inos, cox-2, and cd11b mRNA expression in BV2 cells. The data in zebrafish also demonstrated a significant improvement of ITD on the 6-OHDA-induced locomotor deficiency. ITD also improved 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis in zebrafish PD. We also pharmacologically validated the mechanism with three inhibitors, including LY294002, PI3K inhibitor; LY32141996, ERK inhibitor, SnPP, and HO-1 inhibitors. All of these inhibitors could abolish the neuroprotective effect of ITD partially in locomotor activity. Besides, the molecular level also showed the same trend. Treatment of these inhibitors could significantly abolish ITD-induced antineuroinflammatory and antioxidative stress effects in zebrafish PD. Our study showed ITD possessed a neuroprotective activity in zebrafish PD. The mRNA level also supported our arguments. The neuroprotection of ITD might be through antineuroinflammation and antiapoptosis pathways via PI3K, ERK, and HO-1.
