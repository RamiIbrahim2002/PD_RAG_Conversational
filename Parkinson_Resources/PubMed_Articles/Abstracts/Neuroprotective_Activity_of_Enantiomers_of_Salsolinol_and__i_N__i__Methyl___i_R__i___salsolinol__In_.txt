Title: Neuroprotective Activity of Enantiomers of Salsolinol and <i>N</i>-Methyl-(<i>R</i>)-salsolinol: In Vitro and In Silico Studies.
PMID: 37867702

Abstract:
Salsolinol (1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-6,7-diol) is a close structural analogue of dopamine with an asymmetric center at the C1 position, and its presence in vivo, both in humans and rodents, has already been proven. Yet, given the fact that salsolinol colocalizes with dopamine-rich regions and was first detected in the urine of Parkinson's disease patients, its direct role in the process of neurodegeneration has been proposed. Here, we report that <i>R</i> and <i>S</i> enantiomers of salsolinol, which we purified from commercially available racemic mixture by means of high-performance liquid chromatography, exhibited neuroprotective properties (at the concentration of 50 μM) toward the human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. Furthermore, within the study, we observed no toxic effect of <i>N</i>-methyl-(<i>R</i>)-salsolinol on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells up to the concentration of 750 μM, either. Additionally, our molecular docking analysis showed that enantiomers of salsolinol should exhibit a distinct ability to interact with dopamine D2 receptors. Thus, we postulate that our results highlight the need to acknowledge salsolinol as an active dopamine metabolite and to further explore the neuroregulatory role of enantiomers of salsolinol.
