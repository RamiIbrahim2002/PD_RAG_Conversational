Title: Evaluation of pulmonary side effects in prolactinoma patients treated with cabergoline.
PMID: 37577991

Abstract:
Cabergoline (CAB) is the most used dopamine agonist in the treatment of prolactinomas. Studies related to the treatment of Parkinson's disease have shown that dopamine agonists can lead to fibrotic syndromes affecting the heart and the lung. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible pulmonary side effects of CAB in prolactinoma patients.
