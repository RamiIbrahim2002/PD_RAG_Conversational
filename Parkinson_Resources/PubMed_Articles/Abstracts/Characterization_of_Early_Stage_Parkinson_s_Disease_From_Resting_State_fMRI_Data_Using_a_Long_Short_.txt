PMID: 37555151

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and complex neurodegenerative disorder with five stages on the Hoehn and Yahr scaling. Characterizing brain function alterations with progression of early stage disease would support accurate disease staging, development of new therapies, and objective monitoring of disease progression or treatment response. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising tool in revealing functional connectivity (FC) differences and developing biomarkers in PD. While fMRI and FC data have been utilized for diagnosis of PD through application of machine learning approaches such as support vector machine and logistic regression, the characterization of FC changes in early-stage PD has not been investigated. Given the complexity and non-linearity of fMRI data, we propose the use of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to distinguish the early stages of PD and understand related functional brain changes. The study included 84 subjects (56 in stage 2 and 28 in stage 1) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), the largest-available public PD dataset. Under a repeated 10-fold stratified cross-validation, the LSTM model reached an accuracy of 71.63%, 13.52% higher than the best traditional machine learning method and 11.56% higher than a CNN model, indicating significantly better robustness and accuracy compared with other machine learning classifiers. Finally, we used the learned LSTM model weights to select the top brain regions that contributed to model prediction and performed FC analyses to characterize functional changes with disease stage and motor impairment to gain better insight into the brain mechanisms of PD.
