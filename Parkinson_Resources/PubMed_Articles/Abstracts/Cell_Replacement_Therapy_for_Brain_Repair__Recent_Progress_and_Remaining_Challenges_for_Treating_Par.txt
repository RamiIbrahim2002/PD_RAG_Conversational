Title: Cell Replacement Therapy for Brain Repair: Recent Progress and Remaining Challenges for Treating Parkinson's Disease and Cortical Injury.
PMID: 38137103

Abstract:
Neural transplantation represents a promising approach to repairing damaged brain circuitry. Cellular grafts have been shown to promote functional recovery through "bystander effects" and other indirect mechanisms. However, extensive brain lesions may require direct neuronal replacement to achieve meaningful restoration of function. While fetal cortical grafts have been shown to integrate with the host brain and appear to develop appropriate functional attributes, the significant ethical concerns and limited availability of this tissue severely hamper clinical translation. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cells and tissues represent a more readily scalable alternative. Significant progress has recently been made in developing protocols for generating a wide range of neural cell types in vitro. Here, we discuss recent progress in neural transplantation approaches for two conditions with distinct design needs: Parkinson's disease and cortical injury. We discuss the current status and future application of injections of dopaminergic cells for the treatment of Parkinson's disease as well as the use of structured grafts such as brain organoids for cortical repair.
