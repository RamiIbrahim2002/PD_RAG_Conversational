Title: Differentiating progressive supranuclear palsy from other movement disorders using transcranial sonography: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PMID: 37819487

Abstract:
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is an atypical parkinsonism that presents with different phenotypes. There are still no validated diagnostic biomarkers for early diagnosis of PSP. Transcranial sonography (TCS) is a promising tool in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders; however, there are no systematic investigations about the application of TCS in PSP patients. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to discuss the role of TCS in diagnosing PSP by systematically searching PubMed, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang databases. Of 66 obtained records, 16 articles, including 366 patients with PSP, were included. Our results showed the estimated random-effects pooled prevalence of substantia nigra hyperechogenicity in patients with PSP was 22% (95% CI 12-32%), lenticular nucleus hyperechogenicity was 70% (95% CI 52-82%), and enlarged third ventricle was 71% (95% CI 55-85%). Additionally, a normal echogenicity substantia nigra in TCS showed 70% sensitivity (95% CI 56-81%) and 86% specificity (95% CI 75-86%) to differentiate PSP from Parkinson's disease. In conclusion, TCS is an important supplementary biomarker for diagnosing PSP. At the same time, the diagnostic value of TCS in discriminating PSP from other atypical parkinsonism and between different PSP phenotypes needs further exploration.
