Title: Potential Role of Focal Microvibration (Equistasi<sup>®</sup>) in the Management of Chronic Pain: A Pilot Study.
PMID: 38057548

Abstract:
Chronic pain is one of the leading causes of medical consultation with a dramatic psychophysical and socioeconomic impact. Focal microvibration (Equistasi<sup>®</sup>) is a revolutionary technology that converts the thermal energy of the skin into vibration. Equistasi<sup>®</sup> was shown to be effective in the treatment of gait and balance dysfunction in many pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Our aim was to explore the efficacy of focal microvibration in the management of chronic pain.
