Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder wherein changes in metabolites related to lipids, glutathione, and energy metabolism occur. Currently, metabolite changes in PD have been reported, yet their role in the prognosis of disease remains poorly understood. Functional metabolites can be used to diagnose diseases, especially PD, and can exert neuroprotective effects. This study used a PD animal model and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammatory response model (using the BV-2 mouse microglial cell line) to identify functional metabolites that can identify important metabolic disorders during PD, and comprehensively evaluated their profiles using a metabolomics-based approach. Our results showed that co-treatment with myristic acid and heptadecanoic acid downregulated the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α in BV-2 cells. Additionally, myristic acid and 10 μM heptadecanoic acid significantly inhibited the LPS-induced inflammatory response through the nuclear factor-κB pathway in BV-2 microglial cells, which provides a potential approach for PD treatment. Myristic acid and heptadecanoic acid were the active metabolites found by active metabolomics technology, but at present, there is no research report about their function for PD treatment, and our findings offer a novel research strategy for PD diagnosis and treatment.
