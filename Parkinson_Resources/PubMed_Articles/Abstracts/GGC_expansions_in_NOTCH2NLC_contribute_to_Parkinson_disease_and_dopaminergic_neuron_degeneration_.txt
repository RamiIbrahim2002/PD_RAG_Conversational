Title: GGC expansions in NOTCH2NLC contribute to Parkinson disease and dopaminergic neuron degeneration.
PMID: 37975799

Abstract:
The role of GGC repeat expansions within NOTCH2NLC in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic neuron remains unclear. Here, we profile the NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions in a large cohort of patients with PD. We also investigate the role of GGC repeat expansions within NOTCH2NLC in the dopaminergic neurodegeneration of SN.
