PMID: 37441432

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder complicated by cognitive dysfunctions which are associated with increased caregiver burden, pressure on community health facilities, and mortality in affected patients. Most of the data concerning cognitive dysfunctions in PD are from studies conducted in Europe and North America, but there is paucity of data from Sub-Saharan Africa.
