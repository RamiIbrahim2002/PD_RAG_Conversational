Title: The Neuropharmacological Evaluation of Seaweed: A Potential Therapeutic Source.
PMID: 37998387

Abstract:
The most common neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are the seventh leading cause of mortality and morbidity in developed countries. Clinical observations of NDD patients are characterized by a progressive loss of neurons in the brain along with memory decline. The common pathological hallmarks of NDDs include oxidative stress, the dysregulation of calcium, protein aggregation, a defective protein clearance system, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and damage to cholinergic neurons. Therefore, managing this pathology requires screening drugs with different pathological targets, and suitable drugs for slowing the progression or prevention of NDDs remain to be discovered. Among the pharmacological strategies used to manage NDDs, natural drugs represent a promising therapeutic strategy. This review discusses the neuroprotective potential of seaweed and its bioactive compounds, and safety issues, which may provide several beneficial insights that warrant further investigation.
