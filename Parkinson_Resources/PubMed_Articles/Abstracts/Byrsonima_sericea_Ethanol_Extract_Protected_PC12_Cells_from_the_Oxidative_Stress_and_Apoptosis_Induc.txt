Title: Byrsonima sericea Ethanol Extract Protected PC12 Cells from the Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis Induced by 6-Hydroxydopamine.
PMID: 37725292

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway and oxidative stress is one of the main mechanisms that lead to neuronal death in this disease. Previous studies have shown antioxidant activity from the leaves of Byrsonima sericea, a plant of the Malpighiaceae family. This study aimed to evaluate the cytoprotective activity of the B. sericea ethanolic extract (BSEE) against the cytotoxicity induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in PC12 cells, an in vitro model of parkinsonism. The identification of phenolic compounds in the extract by HPLC-DAD revealed the presence of geraniin, rutin, isoquercetin, kaempferol 3-O-β-rutinoside, and quercetin. The BSEE (75-300 µg/mL) protected PC12 cells from toxicity induced by 6-OHDA (25 µg/mL), protected cell membrane integrity and showed antioxidant activity. BSEE was able to decrease nitrite levels, glutathione depletion, and protect cells from 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis. Thus, we suggest that the BSEE can be explored as a possible cytoprotective agent for Parkinson's disease due to its high antioxidant capacity and anti-apoptotic action.
