Title: Synapses do not facilitate prion-like transfer of alpha-synuclein: a quantitative study in reconstructed unidirectional neural networks.
PMID: 37688644

Abstract:
Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation spreads between cells and underlies the progression of neuronal lesions in the brain of patients with synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's diseases. The mechanisms of cell-to-cell propagation of aggregates, which dictate how aggregation progresses at the network level, remain poorly understood. Notably, while prion and prion-like spreading is often simplistically envisioned as a "domino-like" spreading scenario where connected neurons sequentially propagate protein aggregation to each other, the reality is likely to be more nuanced. Here, we demonstrate that the spreading of preformed aSyn aggregates is a limited process that occurs through molecular sieving of large aSyn seeds. We further show that this process is not facilitated by synaptic connections. This was achieved through the development and characterization of a new microfluidic platform that allows reconstruction of binary fully oriented neuronal networks in vitro with no unwanted backward connections, and through the careful quantification of fluorescent aSyn aggregates spreading between neurons. While this allowed us for the first time to extract quantitative data of protein seeds dissemination along neural pathways, our data suggest that prion-like dissemination of proteinopathic seeding aggregates occurs very progressively and leads to highly compartmentalized pattern of protein seeding in neural networks.
