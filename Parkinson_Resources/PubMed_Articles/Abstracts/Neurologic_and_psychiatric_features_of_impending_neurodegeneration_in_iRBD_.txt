Title: Neurologic and psychiatric features of impending neurodegeneration in iRBD.
PMID: 37680305

Abstract:
Idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is linked to Parkinson's disease and other alpha-synucleinopathies, but various subsets of iRBD may not carry equal risk (i.e., those with depression are at higher risk than those without). Here, we prospectively focus on neurologic and psychiatric aspects of subjects with iRBD, in an attempt to determine what factors are prominent in those who undergo phenoconversion as opposed to those who do not.
