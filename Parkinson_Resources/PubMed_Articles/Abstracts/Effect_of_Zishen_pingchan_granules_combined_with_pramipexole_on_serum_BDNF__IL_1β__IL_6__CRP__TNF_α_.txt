PMID: 37734668

Abstract:
Depression is a common comorbidity in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and treatment of depression can significantly support PD management. Zishen pingchan granules (ZPG), a traditional Chinese herbal formula, may help ameliorate depressive symptoms in PD patients. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of ZPG remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of ZPG on serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in PD patients with depression.
