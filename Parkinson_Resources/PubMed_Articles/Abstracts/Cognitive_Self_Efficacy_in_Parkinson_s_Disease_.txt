Title: Cognitive Self-Efficacy in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37905522

Abstract:
Cognitive self-efficacy (CSE), one's belief in their ability to control their cognitive performance, is important for participation in daily activities and rehabilitation. This study aims to understand how Parkinson's disease (PD) affects CSE. The Cognitive Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (CSEQ) was administered to 47 non-demented PD and 52 healthy comparison (HC) participants. Groups were compared on their self-reported ability to recognize (Part 1) and manage (Part 2) cognitive symptoms and to perform cognitively complex functional activities (Part 4). Relationships between CSEQ scores and individual characteristics were assessed within PD. The PD group had lower CSEQ scores than the HC group for all Parts. Within PD, Part 2 scores were lower than Parts 1 and 4, and worse depressive symptoms and higher medication dosage correlated with lower CSE. People with PD may have low CSE, which can contribute to participation restrictions and reduced engagement in treatment. Occupational therapists should consider CSE with clients with PD.
