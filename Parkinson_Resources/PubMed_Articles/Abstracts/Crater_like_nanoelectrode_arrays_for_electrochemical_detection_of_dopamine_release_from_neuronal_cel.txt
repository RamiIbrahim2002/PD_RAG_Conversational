PMID: 37769679

Abstract:
Stem cell therapy has shown great potential in treating various incurable diseases using conventional chemotherapy. Parkinson's disease (PD)-a neurodegenerative disease-has been reported to be caused by quantitative loss or abnormal functionality of dopaminergic neurons (DAnergic neurons). To date, stem cell therapies have shown some potential in treating PD through<i>ex vivo</i>engraftment of stem-cell-derived neurons. However, accurately identifying the differentiation and non-invasively evaluating the functionality and maturity of DAnergic neurons are formidable challenges in stem cell therapies. These strategies are important in enhancing the efficacy of stem cell therapies. In this study, we report a novel cell cultivation platform, that is, a nanocrater-like electrochemical nanoelectrode array (NCENA) for monitoring dopamine (DA) release from neurons to detect exocytotic DA release from DAnergic neurons. In particular, the developed NCENA has a nanostructure in which three-dimensional porous gold nanopillars are uniformly arranged on conductive electrodes. The developed NCENA exhibited great DA sensing capabilities with a linear range of 0.39-150<i>μ</i>M and a limit of detection of 1.16<i>μ</i>M. Furthermore, the nanotopographical cues provided by the NCENA are suitable for cell cultivation with enhanced cellular adhesion. Finally, we successfully analysed the functionality and maturity of differentiated neurons on the NCENA through its excellent sensing ability for exocytotic DA.
