Title: The Impact of Sex-Specific Survival on the Incidence of Dementia in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37658585

Abstract:
The aim of our study is to analyze sex-specific patterns of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) incidence. We are investigating the extent to which sex differences in survival after initial Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis influence differences in PDD risk among PD patients.
