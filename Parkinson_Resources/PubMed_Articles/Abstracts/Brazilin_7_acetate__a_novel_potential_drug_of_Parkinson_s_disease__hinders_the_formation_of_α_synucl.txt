Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) aggregates. However, there are currently no effective therapies for PD. Brazilin, an inhibitor of α-Syn aggregation, is unstable and toxic. Therefore, we have developed and synthesized derivatives of brazilin. One of these derivatives, called brazilin-7-acetate (B-7-A), has shown reduced toxicity and a stronger effect on inhibiting α-Syn aggregation. It showed that B-7-A prevented the formation of α-Syn fibers and disrupted existing fibers in a dosage-dependent manner. Additionally, B-7-A significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of α-Syn aggregates and alleviated oxidative stress in PC12 cells. The beneficial effects of B-7-A were also confirmed using the Caenorhabditis elegans model. These effects included preventing the accumulation of α-Syn clumps, improving behavior disorder, increasing lifespan, reducing oxidative stress, and protecting against lipid oxidation and loss. Finally, B-7-A showed good ADMET properties in silico. Based on these findings, B-7-A exhibits potential as a prospective treatment for PD.
