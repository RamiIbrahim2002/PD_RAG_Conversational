Title: Identifying the potential genes in alpha synuclein driving ferroptosis of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37803093

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in substantia nigra (SN). The association between the α-syn and ferroptosis in PD remains unclear. GSE49036 was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and intersected with ferroptosis genes. Bioinformatics analysis was used to identify the potential differentially expressed genes (DEGs) included the development of Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. We screened 8 key genes were modulated and crosslinked by 238 miRNAs. Additionally, 5 hub genes were predicted and 38 lncRNAs targeting 3 key miRNAs were revealed. Finally, 3 hub genes (PIK3CA, BRD4, ATM) and the key lncRNA (NEAT1) were verified in neurotoxic PD models. The in vitro experiments showed that PIK3CA and ATM were significantly upregulated or the BRD4 was downregulated in the rotenone treatment and they could be rescued by the specific ferroptosis inhibitor, liproxstatin-1. The expression of the key lncRNA NEAT1 were consistent with the hub genes in same models. This study identified the proposed NEAT1-PIK3CA/ATM ceRNA network may be a specific biomarker in α-syn driving ferroptosis as well as to predict clinical outcomes and therapeutic targets in PD patients.
