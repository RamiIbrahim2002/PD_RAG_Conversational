Title: Nuclear Imaging Data-Driven Classification of Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37638533

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and nonmotor symptoms. Several features have prognostic importance and have been used as key indicators for identifying clinical subtypes. However, the symptom-based classification approach has limitations with respect to the stability of the obtained subtypes.
