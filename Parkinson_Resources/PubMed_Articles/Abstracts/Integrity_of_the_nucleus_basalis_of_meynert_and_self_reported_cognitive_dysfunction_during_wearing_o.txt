Title: Integrity of the nucleus basalis of meynert and self-reported cognitive dysfunction during wearing-off periods in parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37889445

Abstract:
Cognition in Parkinson's Disease can be impacted by the wearing-off phenomenon which results from changes in dopaminergic tone throughout the day. Given the well-established role of the cholinergic basal forebrain in cognition, we hypothesized that the Nucleus Basalis of Meynert may support cognitive processes during wearing-off periods. Specifically, we evaluated whether worsening of cognitive symptoms during wearing-off is more likely to occur with structural degeneration of the Nucleus Basalis of Meynert.
