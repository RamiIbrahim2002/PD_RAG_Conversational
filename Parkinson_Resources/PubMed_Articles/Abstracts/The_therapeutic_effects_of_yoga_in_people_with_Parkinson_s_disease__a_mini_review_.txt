PMID: 38109929

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, second only to Alzheimer's disease. Drugs and deep brain stimulation (DBS) are the main treatments for PD. However, the long-term side effects of drugs and the risks of surgery cannot be ignored. It is therefore important to research safe and effective complementary and alternative therapies for PD. Yoga, an ancient mind-body exercise, has been widely used in health promotion. Although, yoga can address a range of health problems, little is known about its role in people with PD. This article reviews the evidence that yoga improves PD symptoms, including movement disorders, balance function and emotional disturbance. The authors analyze the role and shortcomings of the yoga intervention process, with the aim of providing a scientific basis for the application of yoga training to people with PD.
