PMID: 37864052

Abstract:
We aimed to explore the role of immune and inflammatory indicators in cognitive dysfunction and disease severity in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). A total of 123 patients with Parkinson's disease were enrolled in the PD group and 49 healthy volunteers in the control group. The patients with PD were further divided into 2 subgroups by evaluating cognitive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): the normal cognitive function (PD-NCI) group and the mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) group. Moreover, the PD patients were also divided into 2 subgroups using the defined scale of the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) stage: the early-stage group and the middle- and late-stage group. Immune and inflammatory indicators, including serum Aβ<sup>1-42</sup>, Tau, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>+</sup>, B lymphocytes cell, NK cell, Th17 cell, Treg cell, IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-α levels, were evaluated and analyzed to explore the potential correlation with the cognitive dysfunction and disease severity of PD. Among the 123 PD patients, 60 (48.8%) were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. Aβ<sup>1-42</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>+</sup>, and Treg levels observed in the PD-NCI group were lower than the control group (P < 0.001), while higher than the PD-MCI group (P < 0.001). The levels of Tau, Th17, IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-α observed in the PD-NCI group were higher than the control group (P < 0.001), while lower than in the PD-MCI group (P < 0.01). Using the same method, the results of the early-stage group and the middle- and the late-stage group were the same as above. Logistic regression analysis and ROC curve estimation were performed and indicated that the variation of Tau, CD8<sup>+</sup>, Treg, TNF-α levels was associated with cognitive decline in PD patients, and may serve as markers of PD onset. Furthermore, the variation of Aβ<sup>1-42</sup>, IL-6, and TNF-α levels was found to correlate with the disease severity of PD. The immune and inflammatory-related indicators may represent an important factor in the pathogenesis of PD, cognitive dysfunction, and disease severity. The variation of Tau protein, CD8<sup>+</sup>, Treg, and TNF-α levels are associated with the cognitive dysfunction of PD, which may be considered as onset markers. Moreover, the variation of Aβ<sup>1-42</sup>, IL-6, and TNF-α levels can predict the progression of PD.
