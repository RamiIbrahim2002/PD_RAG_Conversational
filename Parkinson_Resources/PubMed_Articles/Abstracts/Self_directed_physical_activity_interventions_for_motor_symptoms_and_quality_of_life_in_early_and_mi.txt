PMID: 37625216

Abstract:
Self-directed physical activity (SDPA) has been found in previous research to alleviate some of the symptoms of early and mid-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. So, this study aimed to determine the impact of SDPA on these patients in the areas of motor symptoms, and quality of life (QoL).
