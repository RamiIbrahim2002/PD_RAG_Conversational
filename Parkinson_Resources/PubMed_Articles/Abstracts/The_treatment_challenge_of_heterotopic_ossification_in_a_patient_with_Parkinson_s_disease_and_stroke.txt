Title: The treatment challenge of heterotopic ossification in a patient with Parkinson's disease and stroke.
PMID: 37856779

Abstract:
Neurogenic heterotopic ossification (HO) is characterized by bone formation in a non-anatomical site. It is usually seen in patients with spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury. It occurs less frequently in other types of acquired brain injury. Neurogenic HO has only been recorded in a few cases of Parkinson's disease (PD). Its treatment is challenging and may need pain palliation methods. The course and treatment approach of a complicated case with PD and stroke who developed HO of the hip joints during rehabilitation was discussed in this article.
