Title: Generation of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) morphants in zebrafish larvae by cerebroventricular microinjection of vivo morpholino.
PMID: 38302238

Abstract:
Dopaminergic neurons in the brain are an important source of dopamine, which is a crucial neurotransmitter for wellbeing, memory, reward, and motor control. Deficiency of dopamine due to advanced age and accumulative dopaminergic neuron defects can lead to movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is one of many factors involved in dopaminergic neuron development and/or survival. However, other endogenous GDNF functions in the brain await further investigation. Zebrafish is a well-established genetic model for neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration studies. Importantly, zebrafish shares approximately 70% functional orthologs with human genes including GDNF. To gain a better understanding on the precise functional role of gdnf in dopaminergic neurons, our laboratory devised a targeted knockdown of gdnf in the zebrafish larval brain using vivo morpholino. Here, detailed protocols on the generation of gdnf morphants using vivo morpholino are outlined. This method can be applied for targeting of genes in the brain to determine specific spatiotemporal gene function in situ.
