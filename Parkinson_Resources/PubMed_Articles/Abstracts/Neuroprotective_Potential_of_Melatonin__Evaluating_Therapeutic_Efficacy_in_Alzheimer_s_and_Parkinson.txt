Title: Neuroprotective Potential of Melatonin: Evaluating Therapeutic Efficacy in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.
PMID: 38259379

Abstract:
Decreased melatonin levels have been linked to both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), which are the two most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. The development of sleep disorders is widespread in patients diagnosed with AD or PD. In this regard, calcification of the pineal gland, typically seen in the third decade, has been associated with a reduction in melatonin production. Recent studies have suggested that exogenous melatonin application can be utilized to treat sleep disorders in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, research has shown that deficiencies in melatonin levels in patients with AD or PD begin before a diagnosis of eitherÂ disease is made. These findings could encourage further research on melatonin as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis or a possible area for the early treatment of these diseases. Many clinical studies have also produced data denoting melatonin treatment as a method to reduce the detrimental neurocognitive effects of these diseases. Further research on the role of melatonin in neurodegenerative diseases could expand symptomatic and prophylactic treatment options for diseases such as AD and PD. This review investigates melatonin's physiological properties, its role in AD and PD, and current findings on its potential therapeutic benefits in AD and PD patients.
