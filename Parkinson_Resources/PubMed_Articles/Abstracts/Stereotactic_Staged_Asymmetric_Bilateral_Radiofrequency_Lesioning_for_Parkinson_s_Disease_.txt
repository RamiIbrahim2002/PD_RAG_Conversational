Title: Stereotactic Staged Asymmetric Bilateral Radiofrequency Lesioning for Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37844550

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative progressive disorders. Despite the dominance of neurostimulation technology, stereotactic lesioning operations play a significant role in the treatment of PD. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of staged bilateral asymmetric radiofrequency (RF) stereotactic lesioning in a highly selected group of PD patients.
