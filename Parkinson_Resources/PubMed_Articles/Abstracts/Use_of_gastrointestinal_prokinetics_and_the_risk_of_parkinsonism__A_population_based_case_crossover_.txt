Title: Use of gastrointestinal prokinetics and the risk of parkinsonism: A population-based case-crossover study.
PMID: 37491627

Abstract:
The disease burden of parkinsonism is extremely costly in the United States. Unlike Parkinson's disease, drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP) is acute and reversible; exploring the causative drug is important to prevent DIP in patients at high-risk of parkinsonism.
