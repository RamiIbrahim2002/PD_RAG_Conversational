Title: Update on Nonhuman Primate Models of Brain Disease and Related Research Tools.
PMID: 37760957

Abstract:
The aging of the population is an increasingly serious issue, and many age-related illnesses are on the rise. These illnesses pose a serious threat to the health and safety of elderly individuals and create a serious economic and social burden. Despite substantial research into the pathogenesis of these diseases, their etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. In recent decades, rodent models have been used in attempts to elucidate these disorders, but such models fail to simulate the full range of symptoms. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are the most ideal neuroscientific models for studying the human brain and are more functionally similar to humans because of their high genetic similarities and phenotypic characteristics in comparison with humans. Here, we review the literature examining typical NHP brain disease models, focusing on NHP models of common diseases such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. We also explore the application of electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and optogenetic study methods on NHPs and neural circuits associated with cognitive impairment.
