PMID: 37921949

Abstract:
1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been widely used due to its specific and reproducible neurotoxic effect on the nigrostriatal system, being considered a convenient model of dopaminergic neurodegeneration to study interventions therapeutics. The purple pitanga (Eugenia uniflora) is a polyphenol-rich fruit with antioxidant and antidepressant properties, among others. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of purple pitanga extract (PPE) on acute early oxidative stress induced by intranasal 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) administration in rats. Male Wistar rats were pre-treated orally with PPE (1000 mg/kg) or vehicle. After 24 h, MPTP (0.1 mg/10µL/nostril) or vehicle was administered bilaterally into the animal's nostrils, and 6 h later, the olfactory bulb (OB), striatum (ST), and substantia nigra (SN) were collected to evaluate the oxidative stress parameters. Our findings revealed that OB and SN were the most affected areas after 6 h of MPTP infusion; an early increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels was observed, while pretreatment with a single dose of PPE prevented this increment. No differences in thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) formation were observed, although 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) levels increased, which is the most toxic form of lipid peroxidation, in the MPTP group. The PPE pretreatment could prevent this increase by increasing the NPSH levels previously decreased by MPTP. Furthermore, PPE prevents the Na+/K + ATPase strongly inhibited by MPTP, showing the neuroprotective capacity of the PPE by inhibiting the MPTP-generated oxidation. Thus, we demonstrated for the first time the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of PPE against the early MPTP neurotoxicity.
