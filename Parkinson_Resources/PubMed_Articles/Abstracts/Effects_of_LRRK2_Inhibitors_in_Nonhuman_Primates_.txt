Title: Effects of LRRK2 Inhibitors in Nonhuman Primates.
PMID: 37916535

Abstract:
Toxicology studies in nonhuman primates were conducted to evaluate selective, brain penetrant inhibitors of LRRK2. GNE 7915 was limited to 7-day administration in cynomolgus monkeys at 65 mg/kg/day or limited to 14 days in rhesus at 22.5 mg/kg b.i.d. due to physical signs. Compound 25 demonstrated acceptable tolerability at 50 and 225 mg/kg b.i.d. for 7 days in rhesus monkeys. MK-1468 was tolerated during 7-day administration at 100, 200 or 800 mg/kg/day or for 30-day administration at 30, 100, or 500 mg/kg b.i.d. in rhesus monkeys. The lungs revealed hypertrophy of type 2 pneumocytes, with accumulation of intra-alveolar macrophages. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed increased lamellar structures within hypertrophic type 2 pneumocytes. Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes with accumulation of intra-alveolar macrophages admixed with neutrophils were prominent at peripheral lungs of animals receiving compound 25 or MK-1468. Affected type 2 pneumocytes were immuno-positive for pro-surfactant C, but negative for CD11c, a marker for intra-alveolar macrophages. Accumulation of collagen within alveolar walls, confirmed by histochemical trichrome stain, accompanied changes described for compound 25 and MK-1468. Following a 12-week treatment-free interval, animals previously receiving MK-1468 for 30 days exhibited remodeling of alveolar structure and interstitial components that did not demonstrate reversibility.
