Abstract:
The Nurse Professional Development Model (NPD) has been utilized to improve quality of care for several conditions. Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) are susceptible to higher risks while in the hospital. Educational efforts for this patient population are challenged by the small, disbursed number of patients as well as increased turn-over and reliance on temporary nursing staff. To properly care for this patient group, any education has to be hospital wide and ongoing for maintenance of competency. We have used the NPD Model to initiate education for new incoming nurses as well as for continued education for a program that requires hospital-wide reach. Our utilization of the NPD Model for this high risk, low volume patient population has helped us improve the safety of this patient population in the hospital. With this manuscript we detail the need and the educational platform with the hope of it serving as a reference for other institutions facing similar challenges.
