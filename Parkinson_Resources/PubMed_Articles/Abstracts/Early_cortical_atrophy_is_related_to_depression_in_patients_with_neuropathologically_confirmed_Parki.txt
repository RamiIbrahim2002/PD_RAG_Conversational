Title: Early cortical atrophy is related to depression in patients with neuropathologically confirmed Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37992556

Abstract:
Depression is a common comorbidity in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. In non-PD geriatric patients, cortical atrophy has previously been connected to depression. Here, we investigated cortical atrophy and vascular white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in autopsy-confirmed parkinsonism patients with the focus on clinical depression.
