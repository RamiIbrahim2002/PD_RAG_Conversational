PMID: 37488956

Abstract:
The importance of the quality of life (QOL) of carers has been increasingly recognized as it has a wide range of effects on the psychological, emotional, and social outcomes of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Understanding their QOL is important as it reflects their unique characteristics; however, there have been few studies on this in Korea. This study aimed to translate and validate the Korean version of the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-Carer (PDQ-Carer).
