PMID: 38101185

Abstract:
Graphene has emerged as a highly promising nanomaterial for a variety of advanced technologies, including batteries, energy, electronics, and biotechnologies. Its recent contribution to neurotechnology is particularly noteworthy because its superior conductivity, chemical resilience, biocompatibility, thermal stability, and scalable nature make it well-suited for measuring brain activity and plasticity in health and disease. Graphene-mediated compounds are microfabricated in two central methods: chemical processes with natural graphite and chemical vapor deposition of graphene in a film form. They are widely used as biosensors and bioelectronics for neurodiagnostic and neurotherapeutic purposes in several brain disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, glioma, epilepsy, tinnitus, and Alzheimer's disease. This review provides an overview of studies that have demonstrated the technical advances of graphene nanomaterials in neuroscientific and clinical applications. We also discuss current limitations and future demands in relation to the clinical application of graphene, highlighting its potential technological and clinical significance for treating brain disorders. Our review underscores the potential of graphene nanomaterials as powerful tools for advancing the understanding of the brain and developing new therapeutic strategies.
