Title: Traditional Medicine Classification Based on the Nature and Location of Disease in Parkinson's Disease: A Clustering Study Using Pattern Identification Disassemble Presented in Clinical Studies.
PMID: 37819739

Abstract:
<b><i>Objectives:</i></b> The purpose of this study was to investigate a traditional medicine (TM) classification based on the nature and location of disease for pattern identification (PI) in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study also aimed to present evidence regarding the pathogenesis of PD and provide a basis for establishment of individualized treatment strategies with TM. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> An electronic search was conducted in three core databases, three Korean databases, and four Chinese databases. A hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted based on the nature and location of the disease for PD, and the analysis findings were compared with PI in the existing literature. <b><i>Results:</i></b> A total of 79 different types of PI were confirmed in 189 PD cases. Cluster analysis using the nature and location of disease disassembled from PI identified 7 groups: group 1 (wind, blood stasis) comprised 15 studies; group 2 (fire-heat, phlegm-retained fluid) comprised 7 studies; group 3 (liver, Qi stagnation) comprised 5 studies; group 4 (kidney, Yang deficiency) comprised 10 studies; group 5 (liver-kidney, Yin deficiency) comprised 93 studies; group 6 (Qi deficiency, blood deficiency) comprised 18 studies; and group 7 (meridian and collateral) comprised 9 studies. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The findings provide evidence for the pathogenesis of PD and have the potential to translate into more specific TM patterns for PD. The authors hope that their study results will be used as a foundation for development of traditional medical diagnostic methods and treatments tailored to PD.
