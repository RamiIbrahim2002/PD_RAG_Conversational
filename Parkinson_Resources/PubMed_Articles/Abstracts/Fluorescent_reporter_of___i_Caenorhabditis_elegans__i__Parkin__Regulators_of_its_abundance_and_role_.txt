Title: Fluorescent reporter of  <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> Parkin: Regulators of its abundance and role in autophagy-lysosomal dynamics.
PMID: 37811477

Abstract:
<b>Background:</b> Parkin, which when mutated leads to early-onset Parkinson's disease, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. How Parkin is regulated for selective protein and organelle targeting is not well understood. Here, we used protein interactor and genetic screens in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> ( <i>C. elegans)</i> to identify new regulators of Parkin abundance and showed their impact on autophagy-lysosomal dynamics and alpha-Synuclein processing. <b>Methods:</b> We generated a transgene encoding mCherry-tagged <i>C. elegans</i> Parkin - Parkinson's Disease Related 1 (PDR-1). We performed protein interactor screen using Co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis to identify putative interacting partners of PDR-1. Ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) screen and an unbiased mutagenesis screen were used to identify genes regulating PDR-1 abundance. Confocal microscopy was used for the identification of the subcellular localization of PDR-1 and alpha-Synuclein processing. <b>Results:</b> We show that the <i>mCherry::pdr-1</i> transgene rescues the mitochondrial phenotype of <i>pdr-1</i> mutants and that the expressed PDR-1 reporter is localized in the cytosol with enriched compartmentalization in the autophagy-lysosomal system. We determined that the transgenic overexpression of the PDR-1 reporter, due to inactivated small interfering RNA (siRNA) generation pathway, disrupts autophagy-lysosomal dynamics. From the RNAi screen of putative PDR-1 interactors we found that the inactivated Adenine Nucleotide Translocator <i>ant-1.1/hANT</i>, or hybrid ubiquitin genes <i>ubq-2/h</i> <i>UBA52</i> <i>and</i> <i>ubl-1/h</i> <i>RPS27A</i> encoding a single copy of ubiquitin fused to the ribosomal proteins L40 and S27a, respectively, induced PDR-1 abundance and affected lysosomal dynamics. In addition, we demonstrate that the abundant PDR-1 plays a role in alpha-Synuclein processing. <b>Conclusions:</b> These data show that the abundant reporter of  <i>C. elegans</i> Parkin affects the autophagy-lysosomal system together with alpha-Synuclein processing which can help in understanding the pathology in Parkin-related diseases.
