Title: Unravelling the Parkinson's puzzle, from medications and surgery to stem cells and genes: a comprehensive review of current and future management strategies.
PMID: 38015243

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, prevalent in the elderly population. Neuropathological hallmarks of PD include loss of dopaminergic cells in the nigro-striatal pathway and deposition of alpha-synuclein protein in the neurons and synaptic terminals, which lead to a complex presentation of motor and non-motor symptoms. This review focuses on various aspects of PD, from clinical diagnosis to currently accepted treatment options, such as pharmacological management through dopamine replacement and surgical techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). The review discusses in detail the potential of emerging stem cell-based therapies and gene therapies to be adopted as a cure, in contrast to the present symptomatic treatment in PD. The potential sources of stem cells for autologous and allogeneic stem cell therapy have been discussed, along with the progress evaluation of pre-clinical and clinical trials. Even though recent techniques hold great potential to improve the lives of PD patients, we present the importance of addressing the safety, efficacy, ethical, cost, and regulatory concerns before scaling them to clinical use.
