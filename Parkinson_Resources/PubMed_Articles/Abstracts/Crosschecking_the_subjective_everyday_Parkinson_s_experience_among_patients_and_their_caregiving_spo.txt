PMID: 37735017

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) affects all dimensions of the patient's and the caregiver's daily life. There are two questionnaires in German, Bela-A-k (for caregivers) and Bela-P-k (for PD patients), that can be used to assess the PD-related psychosocial burden in a dyad. The patient's and the caregiver's perspective of living with PD can be crosschecked. Four dimensions are explored: physical performance, emotional load, social relationships, and couple/family life.
