Title: Developing Theoretical Models of Kinesia Paradoxa Phenomenon in Order to Build Possible Therapeutic Protocols for Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37486479

Abstract:
One of the main characteristic symptoms of Parkinson's disease is gait abnormalities: bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability and "freezing of gait." Because of these, falls are listed as the second leading cause of death in Parkinson's patients. For this reason, the phenomenon of "paradoxical movement" or "Kinesia Paradoxa" (KP), in which a sudden but brief "disappearance" of parkinsonism is observed where the patients' mobility is normalized (even if temporarily), is of great research interest. Having that as a starting point, the three circuits possibly involved the phenomenon of KP, we headed towards an attempt to approach a first outline of the phenomenon which could give us directs towards the formulation - drafting of some possible theoretical therapeutic protocols or guidelines. It is worth mentioning here that to date there is no confirmed effective treatment for the reversal of Parkinson's disease, except for alleviating the each symptom.
