Title: Correlation of metal ions with specific brain region volumes in neurodegenerative diseases.
PMID: 38812995

Abstract:
There are reports stating that deteriorations in metal homeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases promote abnormal protein accumulation. In this study, the serum metal levels in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) and its relationship with the cortical regions of the brain were investigated.
