Title: Epigallocatechin Gallate: A Multifaceted Molecule for Neurological Disorders and Neurotropic Viral Infections.
PMID: 37590965

Abstract:
Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a polyphenolic moiety found in green tea extracts, exhibits pleiotropic bioactivities to combat many diseases including neurological ailments. These neurological diseases include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. For instance, in the case of Alzheimer's disease, the formation of a β-sheet in the region of the 10th-21st amino acids was significantly reduced in EGCG-induced oligomeric samples of Aβ40. Its interference induces the formation of Aβ structures with an increase in intercenter-of-mass distances, reduction in interchain/intrachain contacts, reduction in β-sheet propensity, and increase in α-helix. Besides, numerous neurotropic viruses are known to instigate or aggravate neurological ailments. It exerts an effect on the oxidative damage caused in neurodegenerative disorders by acting on GSK3-β, PI3K/Akt, and downstream signaling pathways via caspase-3 and cytochrome-c. EGCG also diminishes these viral-mediated effects, such as EGCG delayed HSV-1 infection by blocking the entry for virions, inhibitory effects on NS3/4A protease or NS5B polymerase of HCV and potent inhibitor of ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro/NS3 serine protease (NS3-SP). It showed a reduction in the neurotoxic properties of HIV-gp120 and Tat in the presence of IFN-γ. EGCG also involves numerous viral-mediated inflammatory cascades, such as JAK/STAT. Nonetheless, it also inhibits the Epstein-Barr virus replication protein (Zta and Rta). Moreover, it also impedes certain viruses (influenza A and B strains) by hijacking the endosomal and lysosomal compartments. Therefore, the current article aims to describe the importance of EGCG in numerous neurological diseases and its inhibitory effect against neurotropic viruses.
