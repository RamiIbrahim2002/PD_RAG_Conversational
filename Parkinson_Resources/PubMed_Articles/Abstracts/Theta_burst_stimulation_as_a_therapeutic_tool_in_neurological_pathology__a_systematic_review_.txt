Title: Theta-burst stimulation as a therapeutic tool in neurological pathology: a systematic review.
PMID: 37882997

Abstract:
TBS (theta-burst stimulation) is a novel therapeutic approach in a wide range of neurological diseases. The present systematic review aims to identify the various protocols used in the last years, to assess study quality and to offer a general overview of the current state of the literature. The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We applied the following inclusion criteria: (1) population over 18 years old with diagnosed neurological disorders, (2) patients treated with sessions of theta-burst stimulation, (3) randomized-controlled clinical trials, (4) articles in the English language, and (5) studies that report response and score reduction on a validated scale of the investigated disorder or remission rates. We included in the final analysis 56 randomized controlled trials focusing on different neurological pathologies (stroke, Parkinson`s disease, multiple sclerosis, tinnitus, dystonia, chronic pain, essential tremor and tic disorder), and we extracted data regarding study design, groups and comparators, sample sizes, type of coil, stimulation parameters (frequency, number of pulses, intensity, stimulation site etc.), number of sessions, follow-up, assessment through functional connectivity and neurological scales used. We observed a great interstudy heterogenicity that leads to a difficulty in drawing plain conclusions. TBS protocols have shown promising results in improving various symptoms in patients with neurological disorders, but larger and more coherent studies, using similar stimulation protocols and evaluation scales, are needed to establish guideline recommendations.
