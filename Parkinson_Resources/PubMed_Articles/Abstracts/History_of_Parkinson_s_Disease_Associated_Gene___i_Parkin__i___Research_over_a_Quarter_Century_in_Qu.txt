Title: History of Parkinson's Disease-Associated Gene, <i>Parkin</i>: Research over a Quarter Century in Quest of Finding the Physiological Substrate.
PMID: 38069057

Abstract:
<i>Parkin</i>, the gene responsible for hereditary Parkinson's disease (PD) called "Autosomal Recessive Juvenile Parkinsonism (AR-JP)" was discovered a quarter of a century ago. Owing to its huge gene structure and unique protein functions, <i>parkin</i> has become a subject of interest to those involved in PD research and researchers and clinicians in various fields and is being vigorously studied worldwide in relation to its nature and disease. The gene structure was registered under the gene name "<i>parkin</i>" in the GenBank in 1997. In 1998, deletion and point mutations in the <i>parkin</i> gene were reported, thereby demonstrating <i>parkin</i> is the causative gene for hereditary PD. Although 25 years have passed since the gene's discovery and many researchers have worked tirelessly to elucidate the function of the Parkin protein and the mechanism of its role against neuronal cell death and pathogenesis remain unknown, which raises a major question concerning the current leading hypothesis. In this review, we present the results of related research on the <i>parkin</i> gene in chronological order and discuss unresolved problems concerning its function and pathology as well as new trends in the research conducted to solve them. The relationship between <i>parkin</i> and tumorigenesis has also been addressed from the perspective of Parkin's redox molecule.
