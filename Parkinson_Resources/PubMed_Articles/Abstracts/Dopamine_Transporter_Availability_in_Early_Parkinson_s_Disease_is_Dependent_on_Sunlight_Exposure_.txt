Title: Dopamine Transporter Availability in Early Parkinson's Disease is Dependent on Sunlight Exposure.
PMID: 37670567

Abstract:
Preliminary studies suggested seasonality of dopaminergic functioning, but it is unknown whether dopamine transporter (DAT) expression in humans is also dependent on the seasons. We, therefore, investigated seasonal and sunlight-dependent effects on DAT availability in early Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy controls.
