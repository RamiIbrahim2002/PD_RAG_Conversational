Title: Skeletal muscle-specific DJ-1 ablation-induced atrogenes expression and mitochondrial dysfunction contributing to muscular atrophy.
PMID: 37469245

Abstract:
DJ-1 is a causative gene for Parkinson's disease. DJ-1-deficient mice develop gait-associated progressive behavioural abnormalities and hypoactive forearm grip strength. However, underlying activity mechanisms are not fully explored.
