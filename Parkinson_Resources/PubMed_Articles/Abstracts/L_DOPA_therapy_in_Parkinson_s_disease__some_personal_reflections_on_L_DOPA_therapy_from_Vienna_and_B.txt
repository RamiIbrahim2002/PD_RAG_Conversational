Title: L-DOPA-therapy in Parkinson's disease: some personal reflections on L-DOPA therapy from Vienna and Berlin.
PMID: 37796288

Abstract:
Dopamine was initially considered as a mere intermediate in the noradrenaline synthesis but was then found to be a neurotransmitter. Its depletion resulted in characteristic symptoms in experimental studies and could be antagonized by DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanin), suggesting a similarity to the human disorder ParkinsonÂ´s disease (PD) and a therapeutic potential which was successfully exploited from the 1970s on. This was due to the pioneering work of Arvid Carlsson and clinicians around the world who first worked on the breakthrough of L-DOPA therapy and then on its amendment and modification and on alternative therapies for PD patients. All these developments led to the establishment of PD therapy as we know it today. It is characterized by the availability of many different compounds which are mostly employed in combination and by different methods: orally, intravenously, transdermally, subcutaneously, or duodenally. Here, we present without claim of completeness some personal reflections about causal drug developments for PD patients and reflect on some personal interactions with leading clinicians and basic researchers who cooperated with us. Such interactions are crucial for the creation, sometimes serendipitously, of fresh ideas and to further develop existing concepts to make therapeutical progress.
