Title: Laryngeal symptoms related to motor phenotypes in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review.
PMID: 37621279

Abstract:
This study aimed to systematically review the associations between motor clinical phenotypes in Parkinson's disease (PD) and laryngeal disease symptoms. Laryngeal dysfunctions such as dysphonia and dysphagia are ubiquitous in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD). Similar to other disease symptoms, they manifest variably across PwPD. Some of the variability within PD has been explained by clinical phenotypes. However, it is unclear how laryngeal symptoms of PD express themselves across these phenotypes.
