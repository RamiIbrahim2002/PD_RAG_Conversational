Title: Disulfiram blocks inflammatory TLR4 signaling by targeting MD-2.
PMID: 37487070

Abstract:
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) sensing of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the most potent pathogen-associated molecular pattern of gram-negative bacteria, activates NF-ÎºB and Irf3, which induces inflammatory cytokines and interferons that trigger an intense inflammatory response, which is critical for host defense but can also cause serious inflammatory pathology, including sepsis. Although TLR4 inhibition is an attractive therapeutic approach for suppressing overexuberant inflammatory signaling, previously identified TLR4 antagonists have not shown any clinical benefit. Here, we identify disulfiram (DSF), an FDA-approved drug for alcoholism, as a specific inhibitor of TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling. TLR4 cell surface expression, LPS sensing, dimerization and signaling depend on TLR4 binding to MD-2. DSF and other cysteine-reactive drugs, previously shown to block LPS-triggered inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis), inhibit TLR4 signaling by covalently modifying Cys133 of MD-2, a key conserved residue that mediates TLR4 sensing and signaling. DSF blocks LPS-triggered inflammatory cytokine, chemokine, and interferon production by macrophages in vitro. In the aggressive N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD) in which TLR4 plays an important role, DSF markedly suppresses neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neuron loss, and restores motor function. Our findings identify a role for DSF in curbing TLR4-mediated inflammation and suggest that DSF and other drugs that target MD-2 might be useful for treating PD and other diseases in which inflammation contributes importantly to pathogenesis.
