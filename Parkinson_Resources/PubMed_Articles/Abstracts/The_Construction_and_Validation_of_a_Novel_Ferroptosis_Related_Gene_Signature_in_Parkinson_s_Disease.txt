PMID: 38139032

Abstract:
As a newly discovered regulated cell death mode, ferroptosis is associated with the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and has attracted much attention. Nonetheless, the relationship between ferroptosis and PD pathogenesis remains unclear. The GSE8397 dataset includes GPL96 and GPL97 platforms. The differential genes were analyzed by immune infiltration and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and differential multiple |logFC| > 1 and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) were used to screen differential expression genes (DEGs). The intersection with 368 ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) was conducted for gene ontology/Kyoto encyclopedia of gene and genome (GO/KEGG) enrichment analysis, gene expression analysis, correlation analysis, single-cell sequencing analysis, and prognosis analysis (area under the curve, AUC) and to predict relevant miRNAs and construct network diagrams using Cytoscape. The intersection genes of differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DEFRGs) and mitochondrial dysfunction genes were validated in the substantia nigra of MPTP-induced PD mice models by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, and the protein-binding pocket was predicted using the DoGSiteScorer database. According to the results, the estimated scores were positively correlated with the stromal scores or immune scores in the GPL96 and GPL97 platforms. In the GPL96 platform, the GSEA showed that differential genes were mainly involved in the GnRH signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling pathway, inositol phosphate metabolism, etc. In the GPL97 platform, the GSEA showed that differential genes were mainly involved in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, axon guidance, Wnt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, etc. We obtained 26 DEFRGs, including 12 up-regulated genes and 14 down-regulated genes, with good correlation. The area under the prognostic analysis curve (AUC > 0.700) showed a good prognostic ability. We found that they were enriched in different neuronal cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and microglial cells, and their expression scores were positively correlated, and selected genes with an AUC curve ≥0.9 were used to predict miRNA, including miR-214/761/3619-5p, miR-203, miR-204/204b/211, miR-128/128ab, miR-199ab-5p, etc. For the differentially expressed ferroptosis-mitochondrial dysfunction-related genes (DEF-MDRGs) (<i>AR</i>, <i>ISCU</i>, <i>SNCA</i>, and <i>PDK4</i>), in the substantia nigra of mice, compared with the Saline group, the expression of AR and ISCU was decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and the expression of α-Syn and PDK4 was increased (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the MPTP group. Therapeutic drugs that target SNCA include ABBV-0805, Prasinezumab, Cinpanemab, and Gardenin A. The results of this study suggest that cellular DEF-MDRGs might play an important role in PD. <i>AR</i>, <i>ISCU</i>, <i>SNCA</i>, and <i>PDK4</i> have the potential to be specific biomarkers for the early diagnosis of PD.
