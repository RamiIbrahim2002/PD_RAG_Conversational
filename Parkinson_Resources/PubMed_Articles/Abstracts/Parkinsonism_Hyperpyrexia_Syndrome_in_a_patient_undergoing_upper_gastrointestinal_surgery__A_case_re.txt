PMID: 38204562

Abstract:
Parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome (PHS) is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs due to the abrupt withdrawal or significant dose reduction of antiparkinsonian medications. It presents similarly to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and is characterized by severe rigidity, fever, autonomic instability, and altered mental status.
