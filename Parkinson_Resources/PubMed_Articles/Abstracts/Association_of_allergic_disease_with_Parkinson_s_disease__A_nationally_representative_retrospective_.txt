Title: Association of allergic disease with Parkinson's disease: A nationally representative retrospective cohort study.
PMID: 37544850

Abstract:
The association of allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis with Parkinson's disease (PD) risk is yet unclear. In the few preceding studies, a short follow-up duration was followed for a relatively small study population, and lifestyle behaviors were not adjusted for. Therefore, there is a need for large-scale observation studies on the association of allergic disease with PD risk after considering lifestyle behaviors.
