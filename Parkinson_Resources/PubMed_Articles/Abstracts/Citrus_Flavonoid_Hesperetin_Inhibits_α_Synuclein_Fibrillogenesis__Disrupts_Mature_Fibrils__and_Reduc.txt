Title: Citrus Flavonoid Hesperetin Inhibits α-Synuclein Fibrillogenesis, Disrupts Mature Fibrils, and Reduces Their Cytotoxicity: In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.
PMID: 37870747

Abstract:
Misfolding and subsequent fibrillogenesis of α-synuclein (αSN) significantly influence the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study reports the inhibitory effect of citrus flavonoid hesperetin (Hst) on αSN fibrillation. Based on thioflavin T fluorometry and atomic force microscopy studies, Hst inhibited αSN fibrillation by interfering with initial nucleation and slowing the elongation rate. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect was concentration-dependent with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 24.4 μM. Cytotoxicity experiments showed that 100 μM Hst significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of αSN aggregates and maintained 98.4% cell activity. In addition, Hst disassembled the preprepared αSN fibrils into smaller and less-toxic aggregates. Excitingly, supplementation with 100 μM Hst inhibited the accumulation of 36.3% αSN in NL5901 and restored the amyloid-induced reduction in NL5901 lipid abundance, extending the mean lifespan of NL5901 to 23 d. These findings could support the use of Hst as a dietary supplement to regulate αSN fibrillation and prevent the development of PD.
