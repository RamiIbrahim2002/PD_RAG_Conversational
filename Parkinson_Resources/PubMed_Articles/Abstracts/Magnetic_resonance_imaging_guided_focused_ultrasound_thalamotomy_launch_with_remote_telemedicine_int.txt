Title: Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy launch with remote telemedicine international proctorship.
PMID: 38450308

Abstract:
COVID-19 limitations have hindered the implementation of new technologies by preventing proctors from coming to the site. We share our first experience of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatment with an international remote online proctorship, and develop and evaluate the methodology of remote MRgFUS proctorship.
