Title: Distribution, connection and function of ALDH1A1<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>+</sup> neurons in substantia nigra pars reticulata of mouse.
PMID: 37972684

Abstract:
The massive cell death of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) is associated with motor diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Moreover, as a subtype of DANs in SNC, ALDH1A1<sup>+</sup> neurons show better resistance to PD related neurotoxin. DANs can also be found in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR), however, whether they are ALDH1A1<sup>+</sup> neurons are rarely reported, as well as their projection, function, and reaction in the PD pathology. We studied the distribution of ALDH1A1<sup>+</sup> neurons and track their projection by injecting pAAV. We figured out that, in SNR, 87 % neurons are ALDH1A1<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>+</sup> in ALDH1A1<sup>+</sup> cluster averagely, while ALDH1A1<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>+</sup>: TH<sup>+</sup> is 52 % averagely. There are two enrichment regions of ALDH1A1<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>+</sup> neurons at brgma -3.40 mm and brgma -3.70 mm in the SNR of the nTg mice. Nevertheless, in one type of PD-liked mice model, the proportion of ALDH1A1<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>+</sup>: ALDH1A1<sup>+</sup> neurons are 98 % averagely, while ALHD1A1<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>+</sup>: TH<sup>+</sup> is 57 %. Intriguingly, neuro-tracing discovered that there may be a previously unreported connection between SNR and anterior dorsal thalamus (ADT). The mouse received MPTP stereotactic injection to destroy TH<sup>+</sup> neurons in SNR showed depression behavior, indicated the DANs death in SNR may contribute to depression behavior.
