Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Some cases of PD may be caused by genetic factors, among which mutations in the LRRK2 and SNCA genes play an important role. To develop effective neuroprotective strategies for PD, it is important to diagnose the disease at the earliest stages of the neurodegenerative process. Therefore, the detection of diagnostic and prognostic markers of Parkinson's disease (PD) is an urgent medical need. Advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) culture technology provide new opportunities for the search for new biomarkers of PD and its modeling in vitro. In our work, we used a new technology for multiplex profiling of gene expression using barcoding on the Nanostring platform to assess the activity of mitochondrial genes on iPSC-derived cultures of dopaminergic neurons obtained from patients with LRRK2- and SNCA-associated genetic forms PD and a healthy donor. Electron microscopy revealed ultrastructural changes in mitochondria in both LRRK2 and SNCA mutant cells, whereas mitochondria in cells from a healthy donor were normal. In a culture with the SNCA gene mutation, the ratio of the area occupied by mitochondria to the total area of the cytoplasm was significantly lower than in the control and in the line with the LRRK2 gene mutation. Transcriptome analysis of 105 mitochondria proteome genes using the Nanostring platform revealed differences between the diseased and normal cells in the activity of genes involved in respiratory complex function, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, ATP production, mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum interaction, mitophagy, regulation of calcium concentration, and mitochondrial DNA replication.
