Title: Whole Transcriptome Analysis of Substantia Nigra in Mice with MPTP-Induced Parkinsonism Bearing Defective Glucocerebrosidase Activity.
PMID: 37569538

Abstract:
Mutations in the <i>GBA1</i> gene represent the major genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). The lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) encoded by the <i>GBA1</i> gene participates in both the endolysosomal pathway and the immune response. Disruption of these mechanisms is involved in PD pathogenesis. However, molecular mechanisms of PD associated with <i>GBA1</i> mutations (GBA-PD) are unknown today in particular due to the partial penetrance of <i>GBA1</i> variants in PD. The modifiers of <i>GBA1</i> penetrance have not been elucidated. We characterized the transcriptomic profiles of cells from the substantia nigra (SN) of mice with co-injection with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and selective inhibitor of GCase activity (conduritol-Î²-epoxide, (CBE)) to mimic PD bearing GCase dysfunction (MPTP+CBE), mice treated with MPTP, mice treated with CBE and control mice treated with injection of sodium chloride (NaCl) (vehicle). Differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment analysis, and outlier detection were performed. Functional clustering of differentially represented transcripts revealed more processes associated with the functioning of neurogenesis, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy in MPTP+CBE and MPTP mice than in vehicle mice, with a more pronounced alteration of autophagy processes in MPTP+CBE mice than in MPTP mice. The PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway may be considered a potential target for therapy in PD with GCase dysfunction.
