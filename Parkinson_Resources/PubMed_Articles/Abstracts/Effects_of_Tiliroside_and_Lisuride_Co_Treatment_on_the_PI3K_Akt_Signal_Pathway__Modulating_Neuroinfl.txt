Title: Effects of Tiliroside and Lisuride Co-Treatment on the PI3K/Akt Signal Pathway: Modulating Neuroinflammation and Apoptosis in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37893109

Abstract:
Researchers are actively exploring potential bioactive compounds to enhance the effectiveness of Lisuride (Lis) in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) over the long term, aiming to mitigate the serious side effects associated with its extended use. A recent study found that combining the dietary flavonoid Tiliroside (Til) with Lis has potential anti-Parkinson's benefits. The study showed significant improvements in PD symptoms induced by 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) when Til and Lis were given together, based on various behavioral tests. This combined treatment significantly improved motor function and protected dopaminergic neurons in rats with PD induced by MPTP. It also activated important molecular pathways related to cell survival and apoptosis control, as indicated by the increased pAkt/Akt ratio. Til and Lis together increased B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), decreased caspase 3 activity, and prevented brain cell decay. Co-administration also reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) and Interleukin-1 (IL-1). Antioxidant markers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and reduced glutathione significantly improved compared to the MPTP-induced control group. This study shows that using Til and Lis together effectively treats MPTP-induced PD in rats, yielding results comparable to an 8 mg/kg dose of levodopa, highlighting their potential as promising Parkinson's treatments.
