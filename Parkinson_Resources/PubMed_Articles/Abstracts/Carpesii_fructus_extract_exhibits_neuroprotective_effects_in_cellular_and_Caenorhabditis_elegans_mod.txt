Title: Carpesii fructus extract exhibits neuroprotective effects in cellular and Caenorhabditis elegans models of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37905594

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Despite extensive research, no definitive cure or effective disease-modifying treatment for PD exists to date. Therefore, the identification of novel therapeutic agents with neuroprotective properties is of utmost importance. Here, we aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of Carpesii fructus extract (CFE) in both cellular and Caenorhabditis elegans (C.â€‰elegans) models of PD.
