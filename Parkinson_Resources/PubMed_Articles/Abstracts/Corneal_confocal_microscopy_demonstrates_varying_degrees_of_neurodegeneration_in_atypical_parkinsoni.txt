Title: Corneal confocal microscopy demonstrates varying degrees of neurodegeneration in atypical parkinsonian disorders.
PMID: 37948830

Abstract:
We have used corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) to identify corneal nerve loss as a potential marker of neurodegeneration in participants with Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).
