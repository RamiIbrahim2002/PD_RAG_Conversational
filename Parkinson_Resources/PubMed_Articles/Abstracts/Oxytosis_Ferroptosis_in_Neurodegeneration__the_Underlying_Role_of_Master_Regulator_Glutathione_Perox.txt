Title: Oxytosis/Ferroptosis in Neurodegeneration: the Underlying Role of Master Regulator Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4).
PMID: 37725216

Abstract:
Oxytosis/ferroptosis is an iron-dependent oxidative form of cell death triggered by lethal accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxides (PLOOHs) in membranes. Failure of the intricate PLOOH repair system is a principle cause of ferroptotic cell death. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is distinctly vital for converting PLOOHs in membranes to non-toxic alcohols. As such, GPX4 is known as the master regulator of oxytosis/ferroptosis. Ferroptosis has been implicated in a number of disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD), etc.), ischemia/reperfusion injury, and kidney degeneration. Reduced function of GPX4 is frequently observed in degenerative disorders. In this study, we examine how diminished GPX4 function may be a critical event in triggering oxytosis/ferroptosis to perpetuate or initiate the neurodegenerative diseases and assess the possible therapeutic importance of oxytosis/ferroptosis in neurodegenerative disorders. These discoveries are important for advancing our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases because oxytosis/ferroptosis may provide a new target to slow the course of the disease.
