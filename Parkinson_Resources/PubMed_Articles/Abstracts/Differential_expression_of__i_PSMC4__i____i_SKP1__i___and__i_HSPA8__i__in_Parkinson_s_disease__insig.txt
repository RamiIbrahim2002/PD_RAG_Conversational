PMID: 38115821

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition characterized by alpha-synuclein aggregation and dysfunctional protein degradation pathways. This study investigates the differential gene expression of pivotal components (<i>UBE2K</i>, <i>PSMC4</i>, <i>SKP1</i>, and <i>HSPA8</i>) within these pathways in a Mexican-Mestizo PD population compared to healthy controls. We enrolled 87 PD patients and 87 controls, assessing their gene expression levels via RT-qPCR. Our results reveal a significant downregulation of <i>PSMC4</i>, <i>SKP1</i>, and <i>HSPA8</i> in the PD group (<i>p</i> = 0.033, <i>p</i> = 0.003, and <i>p</i> = 0.002, respectively). Logistic regression analyses establish a strong association between PD and reduced expression of <i>PSMC4</i>, <i>SKP1</i>, and <i>HSPA8</i> (OR = 0.640, 95% CI = 0.415-0.987; OR = 0.000, 95% CI = 0.000-0.075; OR = 0.550, 95% CI = 0.368-0.823, respectively). Conversely, <i>UBE2K</i> exhibited no significant association or expression difference between the groups. Furthermore, we develop a gene expression model based on <i>HSPA8</i>, <i>PSMC4</i>, and <i>SKP1</i>, demonstrating robust discrimination between healthy controls and PD patients. Notably, the model's diagnostic efficacy is particularly pronounced in early-stage PD. In conclusion, our study provides compelling evidence linking decreased gene expression of <i>PSMC4</i>, <i>SKP1</i>, and <i>HSPA8</i> to PD in the Mexican-Mestizo population. Additionally, our gene expression model exhibits promise as a diagnostic tool, particularly for early-stage PD diagnosis.
