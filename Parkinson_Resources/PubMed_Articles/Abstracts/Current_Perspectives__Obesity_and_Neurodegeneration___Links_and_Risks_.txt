Title: Current Perspectives: Obesity and Neurodegeneration - Links and Risks.
PMID: 38196559

Abstract:
Obesity is increasing in prevalence across all age groups. Long-term obesity can lead to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases through its effects on adipose, skeletal muscle, and liver tissue. Pathological mechanisms associated with obesity include immune response and inflammation as well as oxidative stress and consequent endothelial and mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent evidence links obesity to diminished brain health and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Both AD and PD are associated with insulin resistance, an underlying syndrome of obesity. Despite these links, causative mechanism(s) resulting in neurodegenerative disease remain unclear. This review discusses relationships between obesity, AD, and PD, including clinical and preclinical findings. The review then briefly explores nonpharmacological directions for intervention.
