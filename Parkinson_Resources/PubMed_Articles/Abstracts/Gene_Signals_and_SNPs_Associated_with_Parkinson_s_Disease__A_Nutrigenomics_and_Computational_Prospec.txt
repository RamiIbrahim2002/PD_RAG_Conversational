Title: Gene Signals and SNPs Associated with Parkinson's Disease: A Nutrigenomics and Computational Prospective Insights.
PMID: 37858629

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease is the most prevalent chronic neurodegenerative disease. Neurological conditions for PD were influenced by a variety of epigenetic factors and SNPs in some of the coexisting genes that were expressed. This article focused on nutrigenomics of PD and the prospective highlighting of how these genes are regulated in terms of nutritive factors and the genetic basis of PD risk, onset, and progression. Multigenetic associations of the following genetic alterations in the genes of SNCA, LRRK2, UCHL1, PARK2,PINK1, DJ-1, and ATP13A2 have been reported with the familial and de novo genetic origins of PD. Over the past two decades, significant attempts have been made to understand the biological mechanisms that are potential causes for this disease, as well as to identify therapeutic substances for the prevention and management of PD. Nutrigenomics has sparked considerable interest due to its nutritional, safe, and therapeutic effects on a variety of chronic diseases. In this study, we summarise some of the nutritive supplements that have an impact on PD.
