Title: Depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease are insufficiently but more often treated than in other chronic conditions.
PMID: 37452071

Abstract:
Depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are multifactorial and are partly linked to the underlying dopaminergic deficit. However, at least a subset of PD patients may exhibit an unspecific depressive reaction to chronic illness. Here, we compared the prevalence and severity of depressive symptoms in PD patients and disease controls (DC). PD patients reported depressive symptoms at similar frequencies as DC but were on antidepressants, especially Mirtazapine, more frequently. Still, in both groups, a high proportion of patients with clinically significant depressive symptoms was not receiving medication. Diagnosis and treatment of depressive symptoms both in PD and DC should be improved.
