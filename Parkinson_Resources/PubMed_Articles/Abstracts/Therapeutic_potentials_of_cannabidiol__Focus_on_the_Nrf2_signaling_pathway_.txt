Title: Therapeutic potentials of cannabidiol: Focus on the Nrf2 signaling pathway.
PMID: 39491419

Abstract:
Cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid that does not create psychoactive activities, has been identified as having a multitude of therapeutic benefits. This study delves into the chemical properties, pharmacokinetics, safety and toxicity, pharmacological effects, and most importantly, the association between the therapeutic potential of CBD and the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. The relationship between Nrf2 and CBD is closely linked to certain proteins that are associated with cardiovascular dysfunctions, cancers, and neurodegenerative conditions. Specifically, Nrf2 is connected to the initiation and progression of diverse health issues, including nephrotoxicity, bladder-related diseases, oral mucositis, cancers, obesity, myocardial injury and angiogenesis, skin-related inflammations, psychotic disorders, neuropathic pain, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, neuroinflammation, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Multiple Sclerosis. The association between CBD and Nrf2 is a zone of great interest in the medical field, as it has the potential to significantly impact the treatment and prevention of wide-ranging health conditions. Additional investigation is necessary to entirely apprehend the mechanisms underlying this crucial interplay and to develop effective therapeutic interventions.
