Title: Botulinum toxin treatment in parkinsonism.
PMID: 38056063

Abstract:
Botulinum toxin (BoNT) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1989 for facial movement disorders and strabismus, but since that time its indications have been expanding beyond neurologic and ophthalmologic disorders. This article is a narrative review of the therapeutic use of BoNT in tremors, dystonia, sialorrhea, bladder and other autonomic symptoms, levodopa-induced dyskinesia and other problems occuring in the setting of parkinsonism. Though FDA approval is lacking for some of these indications, expert experiences have shown that BoNT is often beneficial in this group of patients.
