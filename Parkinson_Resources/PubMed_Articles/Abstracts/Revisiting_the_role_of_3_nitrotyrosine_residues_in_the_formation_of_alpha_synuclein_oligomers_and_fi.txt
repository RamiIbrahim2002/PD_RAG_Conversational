Abstract:
Nitration of tyrosine residues in alpha-synuclein (a-syn) has been detected in different synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease. The potential role of 3-nitrotyrosine formation in a-syn, as an oxidative post-translational modification, is still elusive. In this work, we generated well-characterized tyrosine nitrated a-syn monomers and studied their capability to form oligomers and fibrils. We constructed tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants, containing a single tyrosine residue, a-syn mutant Y(125/133/136)F and Y(39/125/133)F) and assessed the impact in a-syn biophysical properties. Nitrated wild-type a-syn and the Y-F mutants, with one 3-nitrotyrosine residue in either the protein's N-terminal or C-terminal region, showed inhibition of fibril formation but retained the capacity of oligomer formation. The inhibition of a-syn fibrillation occurs even when an important amount of unmodified a-syn is still present. We characterized oligomers from both nitrated and non-nitrated forms of the wild-type protein and the mutant forms obtained. Our results indicate that the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine in a-syn could induce an off-pathway oligomer formation which may have an important impact in the development of synucleinopathies.
