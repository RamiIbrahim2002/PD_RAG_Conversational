Title: Disability Certification for Parkinson's Disease in India: Challenges and the Way Forward.
PMID: 37970164

Abstract:
Disability certification is mandatory for people with Parkinson's disease to avail any schemes and benefits in India. The process of certification of the extent of disability in a complex disorder like Parkinson's needs to be made less cumbersome and streamlined to ensure that people for whom the benefits are meant are able to avail them.
