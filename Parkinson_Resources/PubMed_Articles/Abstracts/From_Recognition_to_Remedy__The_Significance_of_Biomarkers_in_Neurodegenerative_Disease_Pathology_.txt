Title: From Recognition to Remedy: The Significance of Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Disease Pathology.
PMID: 38003309

Abstract:
With the inexorable aging of the global populace, neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pose escalating challenges, which are underscored by their socioeconomic repercussions. A pivotal aspect in addressing these challenges lies in the elucidation and application of biomarkers for timely diagnosis, vigilant monitoring, and effective treatment modalities. This review delineates the quintessence of biomarkers in the realm of NDs, elucidating various classifications and their indispensable roles. Particularly, the quest for novel biomarkers in AD, transcending traditional markers in PD, and the frontier of biomarker research in ALS are scrutinized. Emergent susceptibility and trait markers herald a new era of personalized medicine, promising enhanced treatment initiation especially in cases of SOD1-ALS. The discourse extends to diagnostic and state markers, revolutionizing early detection and monitoring, alongside progression markers that unveil the trajectory of NDs, propelling forward the potential for tailored interventions. The synergy between burgeoning technologies and innovative techniques like -omics, histologic assessments, and imaging is spotlighted, underscoring their pivotal roles in biomarker discovery. Reflecting on the progress hitherto, the review underscores the exigent need for multidisciplinary collaborations to surmount the challenges ahead, accelerate biomarker discovery, and herald a new epoch of understanding and managing NDs. Through a panoramic lens, this article endeavors to provide a comprehensive insight into the burgeoning field of biomarkers in NDs, spotlighting the promise they hold in transforming the diagnostic landscape, enhancing disease management, and illuminating the pathway toward efficacious therapeutic interventions.
