Title: Effects of mesenchymal stem cell on dopaminergic neurons, motor and memory functions in animal models of Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PMID: 38051903

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and although restoring striatal dopamine levels may improve symptoms, no treatment can cure or reverse the disease itself. Stem cell therapy has a regenerative effect and is being actively studied as a candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Mesenchymal stem cells are considered a promising option due to fewer ethical concerns, a lower risk of immune rejection, and a lower risk of teratogenicity. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells and their derivatives on motor function, memory, and preservation of dopaminergic neurons in a Parkinson's disease animal model. We searched bibliographic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science) to identify articles and included only peer-reviewed in vivo interventional animal studies published in any language through June 28, 2023. The study utilized the random-effect model to estimate the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the standard mean differences (SMD) between the treatment and control groups. We use the systematic review center for laboratory animal experimentation's risk of bias tool and the collaborative approach to meta-analysis and review of animal studies checklist for study quality assessment. A total of 33 studies with data from 840 Parkinson's disease model animals were included in the meta-analysis. Treatment with mesenchymal stem cells significantly improved motor function as assessed by the amphetamine-induced rotational test. Among the stem cell types, the bone marrow MSCs with neurotrophic factor group showed largest effect size (SMD [95% CI] = -6.21 [-9.50 to -2.93], P = 0.0001, I2 = 0.0 %). The stem cell treatment group had significantly more tyrosine hydroxylase positive dopaminergic neurons in the striatum ([95% CI] = 1.04 [0.59 to 1.49], P = 0.0001, I2 = 65.1 %) and substantia nigra (SMD [95% CI] = 1.38 [0.89 to 1.87], P = 0.0001, I2 = 75.3 %), indicating a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons. Subgroup analysis of the amphetamine-induced rotation test showed a significant reduction only in the intracranial-striatum route (SMD [95% CI] = -2.59 [-3.25 to -1.94], P = 0.0001, I2 = 74.4 %). The memory test showed significant improvement only in the intravenous route (SMD [95% CI] = 4.80 [1.84 to 7.76], P = 0.027, I2 = 79.6 %). Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to positively impact motor function and memory function and protect dopaminergic neurons in preclinical models of Parkinson's disease. Further research is required to determine the optimal stem cell types, modifications, transplanted cell numbers, and delivery methods for these protocols.
