Title: Dopamine in the prefrontal cortex plays multiple roles in the executive function of patients with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38103242

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease can affect not only motor functions but also cognitive abilities, leading to cognitive impairment. One common issue in Parkinson's disease with cognitive dysfunction is the difficulty in executive functioning. Executive functions help us plan, organize, and control our actions based on our goals. The brain area responsible for executive functions is called the prefrontal cortex. It acts as the command center for the brain, especially when it comes to regulating executive functions. The role of the prefrontal cortex in cognitive processes is influenced by a chemical messenger called dopamine. However, little is known about how dopamine affects the cognitive functions of patients with Parkinson's disease. In this article, the authors review the latest research on this topic. They start by looking at how the dopaminergic system, is altered in Parkinson's disease with executive dysfunction. Then, they explore how these changes in dopamine impact the synaptic structure, electrical activity, and connection components of the prefrontal cortex. The authors also summarize the relationship between Parkinson's disease and dopamine-related cognitive issues. This information may offer valuable insights and directions for further research and improvement in the clinical treatment of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.
