Title: Optogenetic induction of alpha-synuclein aggregation in human dopaminergic neurons to model Parkinson's disease pathology.
PMID: 37742181

Abstract:
Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation is a principal factor in Parkinson's disease (PD) onset. Here, we present a protocol for optogenetic induction of α-syn aggregation in human midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, facilitating a detailed PD pathology study. We describe steps for nucleofection of the opto-α-syn construct, single colony selection and validation, alongside mDA neuron differentiation and rapid induction of toxic α-syn aggregates via blue light. This establishes a potent human induced pluripotent-stem-cell-based platform for PD drug testing and validation. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Kim et al. (2023).<sup>1</sup>.
