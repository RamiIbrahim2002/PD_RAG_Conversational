Title: Neurofilament light predicts worse nonmotor symptoms and depression in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37499883

Abstract:
The identification of biomarkers that reflect worse progression of nonmotor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently an unmet need. The main aim of this study was to investigate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum neurofilament light (NfL), measured at baseline or longitudinally, can be used to predict the progression of NMS in patients with PD.
