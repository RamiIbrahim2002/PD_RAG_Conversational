Title: Exploring microglia and their phenomenal concatenation of stress responses in neurodegenerative disorders.
PMID: 37429415

Abstract:
Neuronal cells are highly functioning but also extremely stress-sensitive cells. By defending the neuronal cells against pathogenic insults, microglial cells, a unique cell type, act as the frontline cavalry in the central nervous system (CNS). Their remarkable and unique ability to self-renew independently after their creation is crucial for maintaining normal brain function and neuroprotection. They have a wide range of molecular sensors that help maintain CNS homeostasis during development and adulthood. Despite being the protector of the CNS, studies have revealed that persistent microglial activation may be the root cause of innumerable neurodegenerative illnesses, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). From our vigorous review, we state that there is a possible interlinking between pathways of Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, inflammation, and oxidative stress resulting in dysregulation of the microglial population, directly influencing the accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, complement factors, free radicals, and nitric oxides leading to cell death via apoptosis. Recent research uses the suppression of these three pathways as a therapeutic approach to prevent neuronal death. Hence, in this review, we have spotlighted the advancement in microglial studies, which focus on their molecular defenses against multiple stresses, and current therapeutic strategies indirectly targeting glial cells for neurodevelopmental diseases.
