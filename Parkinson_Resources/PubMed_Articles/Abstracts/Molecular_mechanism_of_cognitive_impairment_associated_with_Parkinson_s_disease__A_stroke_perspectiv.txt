Title: Molecular mechanism of cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson's disease: A stroke perspective.
PMID: 38128756

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurological illness that causes several motor and non-motor symptoms, most characteristically limb tremors and bradykinesia. PD is a slowly worsening disease that arises due to progressive neurodegeneration of specific areas of the brain, especially the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Even though PD has continuously been linked to a higher mortality risk in numerous epidemiologic studies, there have been significant discoveries regarding the connection between PD and stroke. The incidence of strokes such as cerebral infarction and hemorrhage is substantially associated with the development of PD. Moreover, cognitive impairments, primarily dementia, have been associated with stroke and PD. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this phenomenon is still obscure. This concise review focuses on the relationship between stroke and PD, emphasizing the molecular mechanism of cognition deficit and memory loss evident in PD and stroke. Furthermore, we are also highlighting some potential drug molecules that can target both PD and stroke.
