Title: Intelligibility of speech in Parkinson's disease relies on anatomically segregated subthalamic beta oscillations.
PMID: 37499882

Abstract:
Speech impairment is commonly reported in Parkinson's disease and is not consistently improved by available therapies - including deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS), which can worsen communication performance in some patients. Improving the outcome of STN-DBS on speech is difficult due to our incomplete understanding of the contribution of the STN to fluent speaking.
