Title: Salience network and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37873396

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with cognitive as well as motor impairments. While much is known about the brain networks leading to motor impairments in PD, less is known about the brain networks contributing to cognitive impairments. Here, we leveraged resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) to examine network dysfunction in PD patients with cognitive impairment. We tested the hypothesis that cognitive impairments in PD involve altered connectivity of the salience network (SN), a key cortical network that detects and integrates responses to salient stimuli. We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a continuous index of coarse cognitive function in PD. We report two major results. First, in 82 PD patients we found significant relationships between lower intra-network connectivity of the frontoparietal network (FPN; comprising the dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices bilaterally) with lower MoCA scores. Second, we found significant relationships between lower inter-network connectivity between the SN and the basal ganglia network (BGN) and the default mode network (DMN) with lower MoCA scores. These data support our hypothesis about the SN and provide new insights into the brain networks contributing to cognitive impairments in PD.
