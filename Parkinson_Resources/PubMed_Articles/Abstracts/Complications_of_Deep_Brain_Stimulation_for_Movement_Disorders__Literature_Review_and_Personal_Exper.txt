Title: Complications of Deep Brain Stimulation for Movement Disorders: Literature Review and Personal Experience.
PMID: 37548731

Abstract:
The contemporary technique of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is very effective for management of movement disorders-including Parkinson's disease, generalized dystonia, and tremors-and has also been successfully applied for novel indications (e.g., intractable epilepsy and chronic pain). As a result, growing numbers of DBS procedures have been performed worldwide; correspondingly, the incidence of associated morbidity has also increased. All complications of DBS can be divided into those associated with (1) the surgical procedure, (2) the device itself, and (3) the applied electrical stimulation. On the basis of an analysis of the available literature and the personal experience of the author, it may be concluded that implantation of a DBS device is a relatively safe procedure accompanied by very low risks of major morbidity or a permanent neurological deficit. Nevertheless, awareness of the possible complications and application of appropriate preventive measures for their avoidance are very important for providing safe and effective treatment.
