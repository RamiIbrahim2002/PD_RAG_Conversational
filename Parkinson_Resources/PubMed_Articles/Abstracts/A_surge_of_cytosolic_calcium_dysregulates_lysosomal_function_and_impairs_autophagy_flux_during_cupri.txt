Title: A surge of cytosolic calcium dysregulates lysosomal function and impairs autophagy flux during cupric chloride-induced neuronal death.

Abstract:
Autophagy is a degradative pathway that plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysfunction of autophagy is associated with the progression of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although one of the typical features of brain aging is an accumulation of redox-active metals that eventually lead to neurodegeneration, a plausible link between trace metal-induced neurodegeneration and dysregulated autophagy has not been clearly determined. Here, we used a cupric chloride-induced neurodegeneration model in MN9D dopaminergic neuronal cells along with ultrastructural and biochemical analyses to demonstrate impaired autophagic flux with accompanying lysosomal dysfunction. We found that a surge of cytosolic calcium was involved in cupric chloride-induced dysregulated autophagy. Consequently, buffering of cytosolic calcium by calbindin-D28K overexpression or co-treatment with the calcium chelator BAPTA attenuated the cupric chloride-induced impairment in autophagic flux by ameliorating dysregulation of lysosomal function. Thus, these events allowed the rescue of cells from cupric chloride-induced neuronal death. These phenomena were largely confirmed in cupric chloride-treated primary cultures of cortical neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that abnormal accumulation of trace metal elements and a resultant surge of cytosolic calcium leads to neuronal death by impairing autophagic flux at the lysosomal level.
