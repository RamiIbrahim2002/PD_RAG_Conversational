Title: Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles: An Emerging Diagnostic and Therapeutic Biomolecules for Neurodegenerative Disabilities.
PMID: 37627315

Abstract:
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a type of versatile adult stem cells present in various organs. These cells give rise to extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing a diverse array of biologically active elements, making them a promising approach for therapeutics and diagnostics. This article examines the potential therapeutic applications of MSC-derived EVs in addressing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). Furthermore, the present state-of-the-art for MSC-EV-based therapy in AD, HD, PD, ALS, and MS is discussed. Significant progress has been made in understanding the etiology and potential treatments for a range of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) over the last few decades. The contents of EVs are carried across cells for intercellular contact, which often results in the control of the recipient cell's homeostasis. Since EVs represent the therapeutically beneficial cargo of parent cells and are devoid of many ethical problems connected with cell-based treatments, they offer a viable cell-free therapy alternative for tissue regeneration and repair. Developing innovative EV-dependent medicines has proven difficult due to the lack of standardized procedures in EV extraction processes as well as their pharmacological characteristics and mechanisms of action. However, recent biotechnology and engineering research has greatly enhanced the content and applicability of MSC-EVs.
