Title: Therapeutic Effects of Baicalin on Diseases Related to Gut-Brain Axis Dysfunctions.
PMID: 37764277

Abstract:
The gut-brain axis is an active area of research. Several representative diseases, including central nervous system disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression), metabolic disorders (obesity-related diseases), and intestinal disorders (inflammatory bowel disease and dysbiosis), are associated with the dysfunctional gut-brain axis. Baicalin, a bioactive flavonoid extracted from <i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i>, is reported to exert various pharmacological effects. This narrative review summarizes the molecular mechanisms and potential targets of baicalin in disorders of the gut-brain axis. Baicalin protects the central nervous system through anti-neuroinflammatory and anti-neuronal apoptotic effects, suppresses obesity through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and alleviates intestinal disorders through regulatory effects on intestinal microorganisms and short-chain fatty acid production. The bioactivities of baicalin are mediated through the gut-brain axis. This review comprehensively summarizes the regulatory role of baicalin in gut-brain axis disorders, laying a foundation for future research, although further confirmatory basic research is required.
