Title: Therapeutic implications of phosphorylation- and dephosphorylation-dependent factors of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) in neurodegeneration.
PMID: 37688751

Abstract:
Neurodegeneration is a condition of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by loss of neural structures and function. The most common neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), motor neuron disorders, psychological disorders, dementia with vascular dementia (VaD), Lewy body dementia (DLB), epilepsy, cerebral ischemia, mental illness, and behavioral disorders. CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) represent a nuclear protein that regulates gene transcriptional activity. The primary focus of the review pertains to the exploration of CREB expression and activation within the context of neurodegenerative diseases, specifically in relation to the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events that occur within the CREB signaling pathway under normal physiological conditions. The findings mentioned have contributed to the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms governing CREB activity. Additionally, they have provided valuable insights into the potential mediation of diverse biological processes, such as memory consolidation and neuroprotective effects, by various related studies. The promotion of synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment in the central nervous system through the targeting of CREB proteins has the potential to contribute to the prevention or delay of the onset of neurodegenerative disorders. Multiple drugs have been found to initiate downstream signaling pathways, leading to neuroprotective advantages in both animal model studies and clinical trials. The clinical importance of the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) is examined in this article, encompassing its utility as both a predictive/prognostic marker and a target for therapeutic interventions.
