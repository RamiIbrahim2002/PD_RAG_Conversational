Title: Readiness for Parkinson's disease genetic testing and counseling in patients and their relatives in urban settings in the Dominican Republic.
PMID: 37644148

Abstract:
Genetic testing for Parkinson's disease (PD) is increasing globally, and genetic counseling is an important service that provides information and promotes understanding about PD genetics and genetic testing. PD research studies have initiated outreach to underrepresented regions in North America, including regions in Latin America, such as the Dominican Republic (DR); some studies may include return of genetic test results. Thus, understanding what individuals know about PD, genetic testing for PD, and their interest in speaking with a genetic counselor, is crucial when assessing readiness. In this cross-sectional study, a survey was distributed to people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) and their unaffected biological relatives in the DR. Questions assessed genetics knowledge, attitude toward genetic testing, and interest in genetic testing and counseling. Of 45 participants, 69% scored the maximum on the attitude scale, indicating an overall positive attitude toward genetic testing; 95% indicated interest in genetic testing for PD, and 98% were at least somewhat interested in meeting with a genetic counselor. The mean PD genetics knowledge score was similar to previously published data. Through free text responses, participants expressed a desire to know more about PD treatment and management, prevention, cause, and their personal risk for PD. These results provide further evidence of readiness for genetic testing in this country but also underscore some gaps in knowledge that should be addressed with targeted educational efforts, as part of building genetic testing and counseling capacities.
