Title: Inflammation as common link to progressive neurological diseases.
PMID: 37964100

Abstract:
Life expectancy has increased immensely over the past decades, bringing new challenges to the health systems as advanced age increases the predisposition for many diseases. One of those is the burden of neurologic disorders. While many hypotheses have been placed to explain aging mechanisms, it has been widely accepted that the increasing pro-inflammatory status with advanced age or "inflammaging" is a main determinant of biological aging. Furthermore, inflammaging is at the cornerstone of many age-related diseases and its involvement in neurologic disorders is an exciting hypothesis. Indeed, aging and neurologic disorders development in the elderly seem to share some basic pathways that fundamentally converge on inflammation. Peripheral inflammation significantly influences brain function and contributes to the development of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Understanding the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of progressive neurological diseases is of crucial importance for developing effective treatments and interventions that can slow down or prevent disease progression, therefore, decreasing its social and economic burden.
