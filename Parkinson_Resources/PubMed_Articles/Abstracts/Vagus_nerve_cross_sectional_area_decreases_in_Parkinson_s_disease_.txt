Title: Vagus nerve cross-sectional area decreases in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37531837

Abstract:
Morphological alterations of the vagus nerve (VN) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are discussed controversially. Several studies reported no difference in VN cross-sectional area (CSA) in PD patients in nerve ultrasound, others found a reduced CSA interpreted as atrophy of the VN and involvement of the dorsal nucleus of VN.
