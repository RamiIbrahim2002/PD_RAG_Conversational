PMID: 37439943

Abstract:
Managing the many issues in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) requires education, continuous support, and specialized outpatient care involving a variety of allied healthcare professionals. It would be greatly appreciated if general neurologists and professionals from various disciplines who work with people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PwP) could remain knowledgeable about the existing therapies and their respective roles within the treatment continuum. The movement disorders specialist and the PD nurse are key actors in the coordination of a targeted and patient-empowering multidisciplinary approach for advanced PD. Affordable and timely access to these therapies for the PwP who may need them is presently a challenge for health systems. Education, training, and support for all the involved stakeholders in the process of PD care may improve quality of life both for PwP and caregivers, and reduce inadequate, expensive, time-consuming, and unsuccessful prolongation of standard medical therapies.
