PMID: 38075945

Abstract:
Radiofrequency thalamotomy is a neurosurgical management option for medically-refractory tremor. In this observational study, we evaluate the MRI features of the resultant lesion, their temporal dynamics, and how they vary depending on surgical factors. We report on lesion characteristics including size and location, as well as how these vary over time and across different MRI sequences. Data from 12 patients (2 essential tremor, 10 Parkinson's disease) who underwent unilateral radiofrequency thalamotomy for tremor were analysed. Lesion characteristics were compared across five structural sequences. Volumetric analysis of lesion features was performed at early (<5 weeks) and late (>5 months) timepoints by manual segmentation. Lesion location was determined after registration of lesions to standard space. All patients showed tremor improvement (clinical global impressions scale) postoperatively. Chronic side-effects included balance disturbances (<i>n</i> = 4) and worsening mobility due to parkinsonism progression (<i>n</i> = 1). Early lesion features including a necrotic core, cytotoxic oedema and perilesional oedema were best demarcated on T<sub>2</sub>-weighted sequences. Multiple lesions were associated with greater cytotoxic oedema compared with single lesions (T<sub>2</sub>-weighted mean volume: 537 ± 112 mm³ versus 302 ± 146 mm³, <i>P</i> = 0.028). Total lesion volume reduced on average by 90% between the early and late scans (T<sub>2</sub>-weighted mean volume: 918 ± 517 versus 75 ± 50 mm³, t = 3.592, <i>P</i> = 0.023, <i>n</i> = 5), with comparable volumes demonstrated at ∼6 months after surgery. Lesion volumes on susceptibility-weighted images were larger than those of T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images at later timepoints. Radiofrequency thalamotomy produces focused and predictable lesion imaging characteristics over time. T<sub>2</sub>-weighted scans distinguish between the early lesion core and oedema characteristics, while lesions may remain more visible on susceptibility-weighted images in the months following surgery. Scanning patients in the immediate postoperative period and then at 6 months is clinically meaningful for understanding the anatomical basis of the transient and permanent effects of thalamotomy.
