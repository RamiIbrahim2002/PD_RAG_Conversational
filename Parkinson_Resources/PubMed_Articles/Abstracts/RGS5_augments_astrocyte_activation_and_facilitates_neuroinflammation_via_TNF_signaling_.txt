Title: RGS5 augments astrocyte activation and facilitates neuroinflammation via TNF signaling.
PMID: 37674228

Abstract:
Astrocytes contribute to chronic neuroinflammation in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder. However, the precise role of astrocytes in neuroinflammation remains incompletely understood. Herein, we show that regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5) promotes neurodegenerative process through augmenting astrocytic tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) signaling. We found that selective ablation of Rgs5 in astrocytes caused an inhibition in the production of cytokines resulting in mitigated neuroinflammatory response and neuronal survival in animal models of PD, whereas overexpression of Rgs5 had the opposite effects. Mechanistically, RGS5 switched astrocytes from neuroprotective to pro-inflammatory property via binding to the receptor TNFR2. RGS5 also augmented TNFR signaling-mediated pro-inflammatory response by interacting with the receptor TNFR1. Moreover, interrupting RGS5/TNFR interaction by either RGS5 aa 1-108 or small molecular compounds feshurin and butein, suppressed astrocytic cytokine production. We showed that the transcription of astrocytic RGS5 was controlled by transcription factor early B cell factor 1 whose expression was reciprocally influenced by RGS5-modulated TNF signaling. Thus, our study indicates that beyond its traditional role in G-protein coupled receptor signaling, astrocytic RGS5 is a key modulator of TNF signaling circuit with resultant activation of astrocytes thereby contributing to chronic neuroinflammation. Blockade of the astrocytic RGS5/TNFR interaction is a potential therapeutic strategy for neuroinflammation-associated neurodegenerative diseases.
