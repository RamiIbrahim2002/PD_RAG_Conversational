Title: Amyloids of α-Synuclein Promote Chemical Transformations of Neuronal Cell Metabolites.
PMID: 37629028

Abstract:
The assembly of α-synuclein into cross-β structured amyloid fibers results in Lewy body deposits and neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease patients. As the cell environment is highly crowded, interactions between the formed amyloid fibers and a range of biomolecules can occur in cells. Although amyloid fibers are considered chemically inert species, recent in vitro work using model substrates has shown α-synuclein amyloids, but not monomers, to catalyze the hydrolysis of ester and phosphoester bonds. To search for putative catalytic activity of α-synuclein amyloids on biologically relevant metabolites, we here incubated α-synuclein amyloids with neuronal SH-SY5Y cell lysates devoid of proteins. LC-MS-based metabolomic (principal component and univariate) analysis unraveled distinct changes in several metabolite levels upon amyloid (but not monomer) incubation. Of 63 metabolites identified, the amounts of four increased (3-hydroxycapric acid, 2-pyrocatechuic acid, adenosine, and NAD), and the amounts of seventeen decreased (including aromatic and apolar amino acids, metabolites in the TCA cycle, keto acids) in the presence of α-synuclein amyloids. Many of these metabolite changes match what has been reported previously in Parkinson's disease patients and animal-model metabolomics studies. Chemical reactivity of α-synuclein amyloids may be a new gain-of-function that alters the metabolite composition in cells and, thereby, modulates disease progression.
