Title: The yeast prion protein Sup35 initiates α-synuclein pathology in mouse models of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37910610

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the pathologic aggregation and prion-like propagation of α-synuclein (α-syn). Emerging evidence shows that fungal infections increase the incidence of PD. However, the molecular mechanisms by which fungi promote the onset of PD are poorly understood. Here, we show that nasal infection with <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (<i>S. cerevisiae</i>) in α-syn A53T transgenic mice accelerates the aggregation of α-syn. Furthermore, we found that Sup35, a prion protein from <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, is the key factor initiating α-syn pathology induced by <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Sup35 interacts with α-syn and accelerates its aggregation in vitro. Notably, injection of Sup35 fibrils into the striatum of wild-type mice led to α-syn pathology and PD-like motor impairment. The Sup35-seeded α-syn fibrils showed enhanced seeding activity and neurotoxicity compared with pure α-syn fibrils in vitro and in vivo. Together, these observations indicate that the yeast prion protein Sup35 initiates α-syn pathology in PD.
