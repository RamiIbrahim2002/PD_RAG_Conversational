Title: miR-100a-5p-enriched exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells enhance the anti-oxidant effect in a Parkinson's disease model via regulation of Nox4/ROS/Nrf2 signaling.
PMID: 37875930

Abstract:
The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been fully elucidated, and there are no effective disease-modifying drugs for the treatment of PD. Mesenchymal stem cells have been used to treat several diseases, but are not readily available.
