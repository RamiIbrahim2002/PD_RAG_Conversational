PMID: 38053209

Abstract:
The Live Well with Parkinson's Self-Management Toolkit is designed for use in the NHS to support people with Parkinson's, their carers and health professionals in managing motor and non-motor symptoms and promoting well-being. The Toolkit was developed based on theory-based behaviour change and self-management techniques in consultation with people living with Parkinson's and health and social care practitioners. There are digital (e-Toolkit) and paper (manual) versions.
