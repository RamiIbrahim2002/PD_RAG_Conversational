PMID: 37957424

Abstract:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was proclaimed a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. There is mounting evidence that older patients with multimorbidity are more susceptible to COVID-19 complications than are younger, healthy people. Having neuroinvasive potential, SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase susceptibility toward the development of Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with extensive motor deficits. PD is characterized by the aggregation of Î±-synuclein in the form of Lewy bodies and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the dorsal striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of the nigrostriatal pathway in the brain. Increasing reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked with the worsening of motor and non-motor symptoms with high rates of hospitalization and mortality in PD patients. Common pathological changes in both diseases involve oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. COVID-19 exacerbates the damage ensuing from the dysregulation of those processes, furthering neurological complications, and increasing the severity of PD symptomatology. Phytochemicals have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. Vitamin C supplementation is found to ameliorate the common pathological changes in both diseases to some extent. This review aims to present the available evidence on the association between COVID-19 and PD, and discusses the therapeutic potential of vitamin C for its better management.
