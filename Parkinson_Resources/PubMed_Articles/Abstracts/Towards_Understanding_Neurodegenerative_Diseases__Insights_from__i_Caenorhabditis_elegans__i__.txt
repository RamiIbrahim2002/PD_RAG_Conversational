Title: Towards Understanding Neurodegenerative Diseases: Insights from <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.
PMID: 38203614

Abstract:
The elevated occurrence of debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), demands urgent disease-modifying therapeutics. Owing to the evolutionarily conserved molecular signalling pathways with mammalian species and facile genetic manipulation, the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) emerges as a powerful and manipulative model system for mechanistic insights into neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we review several representative <i>C. elegans</i> models established for five common neurodegenerative diseases, which closely simulate disease phenotypes specifically in the gain-of-function aspect. We exemplify applications of high-throughput genetic and drug screenings to illustrate the potential of <i>C. elegans</i> to probe novel therapeutic targets. This review highlights the utility of <i>C. elegans</i> as a comprehensive and versatile platform for the dissection of neurodegenerative diseases at the molecular level.
