Title: Proximity extension assay-based proteomics studies in neurodegenerative disorders and multiple sclerosis.
PMID: 38105531

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases impact the structure and operation of the nervous system, causing progressive and irreparable harm. Efforts for distinguishing neurodegenerative diseases in their early stages are continuing. Despite several biomarkers being identified, there is always search for more accurate and abundant ones. Additionally, it can be difficult to pinpoint the precise neurodegenerative disorder affecting a patient as the symptoms of these conditions frequently overlap. Numerous studies have shown that pathological changes occur years before clinical signs appear. Therefore, it is crucial to discover blood-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases for easier and earlier diagnosis. Proximity extension assay is a unique proteomics method that uses antibodies linked to oligonucleotides for quantifying proteins with real-time PCR. Proximity extension assay can identify even low-quantity proteins using a small volume of specimens with increased sensitivity compared to conventional methods. In this article, we reviewed the employment of proximity extension assay technology to detect biomarkers or protein profiles for several neurodegenerative diseases.
