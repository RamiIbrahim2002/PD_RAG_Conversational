Title: Orchestration of a blood-derived and ADARB1-centred network in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37544632

Abstract:
The peripheral immune system is thought to influence the pathogenesis of the central nervous system in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of peripheral leukocytes in AD and PD by comprehensively analyzing the transcriptomic and metabolic features in the blood (N<sub>CONTROL</sub> = 15; N<sub>AD</sub> = 11; N<sub>PD</sub> = 13). The study found an ADARB1-centered module that was associated with diagnosis, phenethylamine, and glutamate. The module consisted of ADARB1, a vital RNA-editing enzyme, LINC02960, and 109 miRNAs. The study also predicted that the ADARB1 and involved regulators were targeted by miRNAs in the ADARB1 module. The integrated analysis of transcriptome and metabolic panel revealed a central role of ADARB1, miR-199b-5p, miR-26a, miR-450b-5p, miR-34c-5p, glutamate and phenethylamine in the regulatory relationships. The study highlights a set of synergetic non-coding RNA related to ADARB1 in the blood ecosystem of AD and PD with dynamic glutamate and phenethylamine, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of these diseases.
