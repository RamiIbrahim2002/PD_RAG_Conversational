Title: Elegant Nematodes Improve Our Understanding of Human Neuronal Diseases, the Role of Pollutants and Strategies of Resilience.
PMID: 37874738

Abstract:
The prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are rising globally. The role of environmental pollution in neurodegeneration is largely unknown. Thus, this perspective advocates exposome research in <i>C. elegans</i> models of human diseases. The models express amyloid proteins such as AÎ², recapitulate the degeneration of specifically vulnerable neurons and allow for correlated neurobehavioral phenotyping throughout the entire life span of the nematode. Neurobehavioral traits like locomotion gaits, rigidity, or cognitive decline are quantifiable and carefully mimic key aspects of the human diseases. Underlying molecular pathways of neurodegeneration are elucidated in pollutant-exposed <i>C. elegans</i> Alzheimer's or Parkinson's models by transcriptomics (RNA-seq), mass spectrometry-based proteomics and omics addressing other biochemical traits. Validation of the identified disease pathways can be achieved by genome-wide association studies in matching human cohorts. A consistent One Health approach includes isolation of nematodes from contaminated sites and their comparative investigation by imaging, neurobehavioral profiling and single worm proteomics. <i>C. elegans</i> models of neurodegenerative diseases are likewise well-suited for high throughput methods that provide a promising strategy to identify resilience pathways of neurosafety and keep up with the number of pollutants, nonchemical exposome factors, and their interactions.
