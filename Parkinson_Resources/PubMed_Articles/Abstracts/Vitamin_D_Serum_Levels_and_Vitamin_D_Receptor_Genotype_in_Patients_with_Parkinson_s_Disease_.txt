Title: Vitamin D Serum Levels and Vitamin D Receptor Genotype in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37832907

Abstract:
Vitamin D is a steroid hormone, known to be involved in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to clarify the relationship between hypovitaminosis D and the predisposition for PD and its clinical presentation. An additional aim was to examine the specific gene polymorphisms associated with vitamin D level.
