PMID: 37902554

Abstract:
The purpose of this article is to raise awareness about the importance of diverting from English-centric approaches in the management of dysarthria associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) in the United States, and embracing a language- and culture-specific perspective when working with linguistically and culturally diverse populations within the context of culturally responsive, precision medicine.
