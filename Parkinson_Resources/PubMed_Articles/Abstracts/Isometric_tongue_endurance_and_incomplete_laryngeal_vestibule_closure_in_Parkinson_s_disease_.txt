Title: Isometric tongue endurance and incomplete laryngeal vestibule closure in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37605286

Abstract:
Dysphagia is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). A delay in laryngeal vestibule closure (LVC) and a reduction in tongue pressure, may affect swallowing safety and increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration.
