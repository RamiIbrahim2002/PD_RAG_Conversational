Title: Parkinson's Disease and the Heart: Studying Cardiac Metabolism in the 6-Hydroxydopamine Model.
PMID: 37569578

Abstract:
Parkinson's-disease (PD) is an incurable, age-related neurodegenerative disease, and its global prevalence of disability and death has increased exponentially. Although motor symptoms are the characteristic manifestations of PD, the clinical spectrum also contains a wide variety of non-motor symptoms, which are the main cause of disability and determinants of the decrease in a patient's quality of life. Noteworthy in this regard is the stress on the cardiac system that is often observed in the course of PD; however, its effects have not yet been adequately researched. Here, an untargeted metabolomics approach was used to assess changes in cardiac metabolism in the 6-hydroxydopamine model of PD. Beta-sitosterol, campesterol, cholesterol, monoacylglycerol, Î±-tocopherol, stearic acid, beta-glycerophosphoric acid, o-phosphoethanolamine, myo-inositol-1-phosphate, alanine, valine and allothreonine are the metabolites that significantly discriminate parkinsonian rats from sham counterparts. Upon analysis of the metabolic pathways with the aim of uncovering the main biological pathways involved in concentration patterns of cardiac metabolites, the biosynthesis of both phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine, the glucose-alanine cycle, glutathione metabolism and plasmalogen synthesis most adequately differentiated sham and parkinsonian rats. Our results reveal that both lipid and energy metabolism are particularly involved in changes in cardiac metabolism in PD. These results provide insight into cardiac metabolic signatures in PD and indicate potential targets for further investigation.
