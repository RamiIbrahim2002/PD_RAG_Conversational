Abstract:
Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (<i>LRRK2</i>) gene cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD), with the most common causative mutation being the <i>LRRK2</i> p.G2019S within the kinase domain. LRRK2 protein is highly expressed in the human brain and also in the periphery, and high expression of dominant PD genes in immune cells suggests involvement of microglia and macrophages in inflammation related to PD. LRRK2 is known to respond to extracellular signalling including TLR4, resulting in alterations in gene expression, with the response to TLR2 signalling through zymosan being less known. Here, we investigated the effects of zymosan, a TLR2 agonist and the potent and specific LRRK2 kinase inhibitor MLi-2 on gene expression in microglia from <i>LRRK2-WT</i> and <i>LRRK2</i> p.G2019S knock-in mice by RNA-sequencing analysis. We observed both overlapping and distinct zymosan and MLi-2 mediated gene expression profiles in microglia. At least two candidate genome-wide association (GWAS) hits for PD, CathepsinB (<i>Ctsb</i>) and Glycoprotein-nmb (<i>Gpnmb</i>), were notably downregulated by zymosan treatment. Genes involved in inflammatory response and nervous system development were up and downregulated, respectively, with zymosan treatment, while MLi-2 treatment particularly exhibited upregulated genes for ion transmembrane transport regulation. Furthermore, we observed that the top twenty most significantly differentially expressed genes in <i>LRRK2</i> p.G2019S microglia show enriched biological processes in iron transport and response to oxidative stress. Overall, these results suggest that microglial LRRK2 may contribute to PD pathogenesis through altered inflammatory pathways. Our findings should encourage future investigations of these putative avenues in the context of PD pathogenesis.
