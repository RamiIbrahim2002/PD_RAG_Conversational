Title: Importance of time to ON versus wearing OFF in total daily OFF time experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37517986

Abstract:
Most patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) receiving levodopa (LD)/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors develop motor fluctuations with an increasing amount of OFF time, negatively impacting patient quality of life. Herein, we review the evidence supporting the substantial, yet underappreciated contribution of delays in time to ON (including delayed ON and no ON) to total daily OFF time. Most clinical studies use patient diaries that do not capture time to ON and wearing OFF separately as related to LD dosing, and consequently, most OFF time has generally been attributed to wearing OFF. Hence, most treatment regimens focus on reducing wearing OFF by changing LD dosing/formulations and/or using "ON-extenders" (eg, catechol-o-methyltransferase inhibitors, monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors, extended-release amantadine, and adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonists). However, the literature describing approved treatments for PD that has focused on delays in time to ON is sparse and suggests this type of OFF may comprise more than twice the amount of total daily OFF time as wearing OFF. Here, we advocate for the importance of measuring and adequately addressing delays in time to ON and build support for the consistent inclusion of the time to ON measurement in future clinical trials.
