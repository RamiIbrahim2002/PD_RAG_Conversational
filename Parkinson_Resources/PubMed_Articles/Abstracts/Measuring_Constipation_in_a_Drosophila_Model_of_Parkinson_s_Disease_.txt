Title: Measuring Constipation in a Drosophila Model of Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37811970

Abstract:
Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are common, difficult to treat, and significantly impair quality of life. One prevalent non-motor symptom is constipation, which can precede the diagnosis of PD by years or even decades. Constipation has been underexplored in animal models of PD and lacks specific therapies. This assay utilizes a Drosophila model of PD in which human alpha-synuclein is expressed under a pan-neuronal driver. Flies expressing alpha-synuclein develop the hallmark features of PD: the loss of dopaminergic neurons, motor impairment, and alpha-synuclein inclusions. This protocol outlines a method for studying constipation in these flies. Flies are placed on fly food with a blue color additive overnight and then transferred to standard food the following day. They are subsequently moved to new vials with standard fly food every hour for 8 h. Before each transfer, the percentage of blue-colored fecal spots compared to the total fecal spots on the vial wall is calculated. Control flies that lack alpha-synuclein expel all the blue dye hours before flies expressing alpha-synuclein. Additionally, the passage of blue-colored food from the gut can be monitored with simple photography. The simplicity of this assay enables its use in forward genetic or chemical screens to identify modifiers of constipation in Drosophila.
