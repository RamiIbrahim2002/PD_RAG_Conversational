Title: What do we know about astrocytes and the antidepressant effects of DBS?
PMID: 37558154

Abstract:
Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a debilitating condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been widely used with excellent outcomes in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, tremor, and dystonia. More recently, DBS has been proposed as an adjuvant therapy for TRD. To date, the antidepressant efficacy of DBS is still controversial, and its mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the nervous system. Once believed to be a "supporting" element for neuronal function, astrocytes are now recognized to play a major role in brain homeostasis, neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity. Because of its many roles in complex multi-factorial disorders, including TRD, understanding the effect of DBS on astrocytes is pivotal to improve our knowledge about the antidepressant effects of this therapy. In depression, the number of astrocytes and the expression of astrocytic markers are decreased. One of the potential consequences of this reduced astrocytic function is the development of aberrant glutamatergic neurotransmission, which has been documented in several models of depression-like behavior. Evidence from preclinical work suggests that DBS may directly influence astrocytic activity, modulating the release of gliotransmitters, reducing neuroinflammation, and altering structural tissue organization. Compelling evidence for an involvement of astrocytes in potential mechanisms of DBS derive from studies suggesting that pharmacological lesions or the inhibition of these cells abolishes the antidepressant-like effect of DBS. In this review, we summarize preclinical data suggesting that the modulation of astrocytes may be an important mechanism for the antidepressant-like effects of DBS.
