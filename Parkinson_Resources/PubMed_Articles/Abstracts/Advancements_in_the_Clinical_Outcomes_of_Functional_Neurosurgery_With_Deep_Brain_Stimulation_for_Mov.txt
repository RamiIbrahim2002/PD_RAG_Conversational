Title: Advancements in the Clinical Outcomes of Functional Neurosurgery With Deep Brain Stimulation for Movement Disorders: A Literature Review.
PMID: 37456406

Abstract:
This literature review explores recent advancements in deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery for movement disorders. It highlights notable improvements, including closed-loop stimulation techniques, optogenetics, and improved surgical targeting. Positive clinical outcomes with low complication rates and improved motor symptoms are consistently reported. The review emphasizes the importance of minimizing risks through meticulous surgical practices and discusses potential complications associated with DBS surgery. Future prospects focus on enhancing technology, refining surgical techniques, and conducting further research. Closed-loop stimulation optimizes DBS efficacy by tailoring stimulation parameters to individual patient needs. Optogenetics offers precise modulation of neural activity with light-sensitive proteins, enabling more targeted treatments. Cybersecurity measures are essential due to the integration of wireless and digital technologies in DBS systems. DBS surgery has significantly improved the management of movement disorders with its safety and effectiveness. Ongoing research in closed-loop stimulation, optogenetics, and cybersecurity is expected to further enhance DBS technology and outcomes, benefiting patients with treatment-resistant movement disorders.
