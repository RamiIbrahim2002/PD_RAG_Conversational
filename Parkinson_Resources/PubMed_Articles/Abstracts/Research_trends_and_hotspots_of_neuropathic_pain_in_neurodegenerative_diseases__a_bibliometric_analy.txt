PMID: 37503342

Abstract:
Neuropathic pain is caused by a neurological injury or disease and can have a significant impact on people's daily lives. Studies have shown that neuropathic pain is commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In recent years, there has been a lot of literature on the relationship between neuropathic pain and neurodegenerative diseases. However, bibliometrics is rarely used in analyzing the general aspects of studies on neuropathic pain in neurodegenerative diseases.
