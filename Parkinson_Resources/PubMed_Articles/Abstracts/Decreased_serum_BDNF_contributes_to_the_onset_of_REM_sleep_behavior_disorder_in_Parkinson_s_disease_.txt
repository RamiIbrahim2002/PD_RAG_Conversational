Title: Decreased serum BDNF contributes to the onset of REM sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's disease patients.
PMID: 37423466

Abstract:
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes neuroprotection and neuroregeneration. BDNF enhances the survival of dopaminergic neurons and improves dopaminergic neurotransmission and motor performance in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the association between BDNF levels and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in PD patients has received limited attention.
