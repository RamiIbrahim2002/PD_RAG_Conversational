Title: High-Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) Protein in Parkinson's Disease Research: A 10-Year Bibliometric Analysis.
PMID: 37519176

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD), the most prevalent motoric neurodegenerative disease, has been intensively studied to better comprehend its complicated pathogenesis. Chronic neuroinflammation is a major factor contributing to the development of PD. Reportedly, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is capable of mediating neuroinflammatory response. In this regard, knowledge mapping of the research linking HMGB1 to PD is necessary.
