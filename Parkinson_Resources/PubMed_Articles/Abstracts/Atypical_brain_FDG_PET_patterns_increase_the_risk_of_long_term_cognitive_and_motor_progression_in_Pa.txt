Title: Atypical brain FDG-PET patterns increase the risk of long-term cognitive and motor progression in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37716228

Abstract:
Brain hypometabolism patterns have been previously associated with cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD). Our aim is to evaluate the impact of single-subject fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET brain hypometabolism on long-term cognitive and motor outcomes in PD.
