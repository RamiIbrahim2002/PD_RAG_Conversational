Abstract:
Monoamine oxidase (MAO, EC 1.4.3.4) is responsible for the oxidative breakdown of both endogenous and exogenous amines and exists in MAO-A and MAO-B isomers. Eighteen indole-based phenylallylidene derivatives were synthesized via nucleophilic addition reactions comprising three sub-series, <b>IHC</b>, <b>IHMC</b>, and <b>IHNC</b>, and were developed and examined for their ability to inhibit MAO. Among them, compound <b>IHC3</b> showed a strong MAO-B inhibitory effect with an IC<sub>50</sub> (<i>half-maximal inhibitory concentration</i>) value of 1.672 μM, followed by <b>IHC2</b> (IC<sub>50</sub> = 16.934 μM). Additionally, <b>IHC3</b> showed the highest selectivity index (SI) value of >23.92. The effectiveness of <b>IHC3</b> was lower than the reference pargyline (0.14 μM); however, the SI value was higher than pargyline (17.16). Structurally, the <b>IHC</b> (-H in the B-ring) sub-series exhibited relatively stronger MAO-B inhibition than the others. In the <b>IHC</b> series, <b>IHC3</b> (-F in the A-ring) exhibited stronger MAO-B suppression than the other substituted derivatives in the order -F > -Br > -Cl > -OCH<sub>3</sub>, -CH<sub>3</sub>, and -H at the 2-position in the A-ring. In the reversibility and enzyme kinetics experiments, <b>IHC3</b> was a reversible inhibitor with a K<sub>i</sub> value of 0.51 ± 0.15 μM for MAO-B. Further, it was observed that <b>IHC3</b> greatly decreased the cell death caused by rotenone in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. A molecular docking study of the lead molecule was also performed to determine hypothetical interactions in the enzyme-binding cavity. These findings suggest that <b>IHC3</b> is a strong, specific, and reversible MAO-B inhibitor that can be used to treat neurological diseases.
