Title: The Molecular Mechanisms of the Relationship between Insulin Resistance and Parkinson's Disease Pathogenesis.
PMID: 37630775

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative condition resulting from the loss of dopaminergic neurons. This neuronal loss leads to motor and non-motor neurological symptoms. Most PD cases are idiopathic, and no cure is available. Recently, it has been proposed that insulin resistance (IR) could be a central factor in PD development. IR has been associated with PD neuropathological features like Î±-synuclein aggregation, dopaminergic neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and autophagy. These features are related to impaired neurological metabolism, neuronal death, and the aggravation of PD symptoms. Moreover, pharmacological options that involve insulin signaling improvement and dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic strategies have been under development. These drugs could prevent the metabolic pathways involved in neuronal damage. All these approaches could improve PD outcomes. Also, new biomarker identification may allow for an earlier PD diagnosis in high-risk individuals. This review describes the main pathways implicated in PD development involving IR. Also, it presents several therapeutic options that are directed at insulin signaling improvement and could be used in PD treatment. The understanding of IR molecular mechanisms involved in neurodegenerative development could enhance PD therapeutic options and diagnosis.
