Title: White matter hyperintensities in cognitive impairment with Lewy body disease: a multicentre study.
PMID: 37500565

Abstract:
White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are associated with cognitive deficits and worse clinical outcomes in dementia, but rare studies have been carried out of cognitive impairment in Lewy body disease (CI-LB) patients. The objective was to investigate the associations between WMHs and clinical manifestations in patients with CI-LB.
