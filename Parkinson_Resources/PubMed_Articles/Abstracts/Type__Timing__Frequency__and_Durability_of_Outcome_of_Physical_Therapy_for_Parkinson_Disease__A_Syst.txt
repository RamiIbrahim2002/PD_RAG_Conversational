PMID: 37477916

Abstract:
Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative syndrome affecting approximately 1% of the population older than 60 years, and a major goal of treatment is preservation of physical function through physical therapy (PT). Although PT outcomes for PD are well documented, aggregate information on the parameters of PT are needed to guide implementation.
