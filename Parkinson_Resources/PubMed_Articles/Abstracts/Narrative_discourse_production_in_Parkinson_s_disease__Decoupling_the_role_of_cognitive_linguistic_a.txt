Title: Narrative discourse production in Parkinson's disease: Decoupling the role of cognitive-linguistic and motor speech changes.
PMID: 37576215

Abstract:
the interplay between neuropsychological and communicative abilities in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been relatively overlooked, and it is not entirely understood which difficulties are consequent to impaired motor control, and which have a linguistic/cognitive basis. Here, we examined narrative discourse in PD using a multi-level analysis procedure considering sentence-level (productivity, lexical-grammatical processing) and discourse-level processes (narrative organization, informativeness), and partialling out patients' motor speech impairments. The interaction between cognitive (i.e. linguistic and executive) and communication abilities was also investigated.
