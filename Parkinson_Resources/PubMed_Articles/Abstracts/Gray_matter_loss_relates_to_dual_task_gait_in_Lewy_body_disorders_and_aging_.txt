Title: Gray matter loss relates to dual task gait in Lewy body disorders and aging.
PMID: 37902878

Abstract:
Within the spectrum of Lewy body disorders (LBD), both Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterized by gait and balance disturbances, which become more prominent under dual-task (DT) conditions. The brain substrates underlying DT gait variations, however, remain poorly understood in LBD.
