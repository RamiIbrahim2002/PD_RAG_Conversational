Title: Network connectivity and local transcriptomic vulnerability underpin cortical atrophy progression in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38016407

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease pathology is hypothesized to spread through the brain via axonal connections between regions and is further modulated by local vulnerabilities within those regions. The resulting changes to brain morphology have previously been demonstrated in both prodromal and de novo Parkinson's disease patients. However, it remains unclear whether the pattern of atrophy progression in Parkinson's disease over time is similarly explained by network-based spreading and local vulnerability. We address this gap by mapping the trajectory of cortical atrophy rates in a large, multi-centre cohort of Parkinson's disease patients and relate this atrophy progression pattern to network architecture and gene expression profiles. Across 4-year follow-up visits, increased atrophy rates were observed in posterior, temporal, and superior frontal cortices. We demonstrated that this progression pattern was shaped by network connectivity. Regional atrophy rates were strongly related to atrophy rates across structurally and functionally connected regions. We also found that atrophy progression was associated with specific gene expression profiles. The genes whose spatial distribution in the brain was most related to atrophy rate were those enriched for mitochondrial and metabolic function. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that both global and local brain features influence vulnerability to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.
