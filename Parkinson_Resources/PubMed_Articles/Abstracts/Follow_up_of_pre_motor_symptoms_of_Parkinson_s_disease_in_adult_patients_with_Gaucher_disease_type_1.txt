Title: Follow-up of pre-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease in adult patients with Gaucher disease type 1 and analysis of their lysosomal enzyme profiles in the CSF.
PMID: 37784132

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Its classic motor symptoms may be preceded by non-motor symptoms (NMS). Population studies have identified GBA variants as risk factors for idiopathic PD. The increased risk of PD has also been suggested in other Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs).
