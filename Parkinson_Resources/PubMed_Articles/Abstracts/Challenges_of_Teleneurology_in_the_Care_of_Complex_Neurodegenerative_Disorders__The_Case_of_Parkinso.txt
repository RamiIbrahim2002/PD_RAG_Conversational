Title: Challenges of Teleneurology in the Care of Complex Neurodegenerative Disorders: The Case of Parkinson's Disease with Possible Solutions.
PMID: 38132077

Abstract:
Teleneurology is a specialist field within the realm of telemedicine, which is dedicated to delivering neurological care and consultations through virtual encounters. Teleneurology has been successfully used in acute care (e.g., stroke) and outpatient evaluation for chronic neurological conditions such as epilepsy and headaches. However, for some neurologic entities like Parkinson's disease, in which an in-depth physical examination by palpating muscles and performing neurologic maneuvers is the mainstay of monitoring the effects of medication, the yield and feasibility of a virtual encounter are low. Therefore, in this prospective review, we discuss two promising teleneurology approaches and propose adjustments to enhance the value of virtual encounters by improving the validity of neurological examination: 'hybrid teleneurology', which involves revising the workflow of virtual encounters; and 'artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted teleneurology', namely the use of biosensors and wearables and data processing using AI.
