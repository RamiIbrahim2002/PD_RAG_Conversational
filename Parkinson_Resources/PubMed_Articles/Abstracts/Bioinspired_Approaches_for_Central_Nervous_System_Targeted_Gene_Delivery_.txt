Title: Bioinspired Approaches for Central Nervous System Targeted Gene Delivery.
PMID: 38100377

Abstract:
Disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) which include a wide range of neurodegenerative and neurological conditions have become a serious global issue. The presence of CNS barriers poses a significant challenge to the progress of designing effective therapeutic delivery systems, limiting the effectiveness of drugs, genes, and other therapeutic agents. Natural nanocarriers present in biological systems have inspired researchers to design unique delivery systems through biomimicry. As natural resource derived delivery systems are more biocompatible, current research has been focused on the development of delivery systems inspired by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and mammalian cells. Despite their structural potential and extensive physiological function, making them an excellent choice for biomaterial engineering, the delivery of nucleic acids remains challenging due to their instability in biological systems. Similarly, the efficient delivery of genetic material within the tissues of interest remains a hurdle due to a lack of selectivity and targeting ability. Considering that gene therapies are the holy grail for intervention in diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Huntington's disease, this review centers around recent advances in bioinspired approaches to gene delivery for the prevention of CNS disorders.
