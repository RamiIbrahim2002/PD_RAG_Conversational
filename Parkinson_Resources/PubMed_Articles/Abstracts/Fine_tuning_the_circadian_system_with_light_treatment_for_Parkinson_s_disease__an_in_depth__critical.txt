Title: Fine-tuning the circadian system with light treatment for Parkinson's disease: an in-depth, critical review.
PMID: 37609845

Abstract:
Late in the twentieth century, interest intensified regarding the involvement of the circadian system in the aetiology and treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been envisaged that this approach might provide relief beyond the limited benefits and severe side effects achieved by dopamine (DA) replacement. In the first clinical article, published in 1996, polychromatic light was used to shift the circadian clock as it is considered to be the most powerful zeitgeber (time keeper) that can be implemented to realign circadian phase. Since that time, 11 additional articles have implemented light treatment (LT) in various forms as an adjuvant to DA replacement. In spite of the growing interest in this area, the systematic exploration of LT in PD has been stymied by several methodological factors. Such factors include time of LT presentation, duration of studies undertaken, frequency of light employed, dose of light prescribed and relevance of experimental design to the prolonged course of the illness. On this basis, it is the purpose of this review to provide an in-depth examination of these papers, and the underlying preclinical work, to provide critique, thereby giving direction for future studies in therapeutic applications of LT for PD. Consideration of this collective work may serve to carve a path for future research and thereby improve the lives of those suffering from this debilitating disorder.
