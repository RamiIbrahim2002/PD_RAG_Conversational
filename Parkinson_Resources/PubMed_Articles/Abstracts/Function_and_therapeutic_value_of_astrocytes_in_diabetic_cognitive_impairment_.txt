Title: Function and therapeutic value of astrocytes in diabetic cognitive impairment.
PMID: 37543309

Abstract:
Diabetic cognitive impairment (DCI) is a complex complication of diabetes in the central nervous system, and its pathological mechanism is still being explored. Astrocytes are abundant glial cells in central nervous system that perform diverse functions in health and disease. Accumulating excellent research has identified astrocyte dysfunction in many neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease, aging and Parkinson's disease), and summarized and discussed its pathological mechanisms and potential therapeutic value. However, the contribution of astrocytes to DCI has been largely overlooked. In this review, we first systematically summarized the effects and mechanisms of diabetes on brain astrocytes, and found that the diabetic environment (such as hyperglycemia, advanced glycation end products and cerebral insulin resistance) mediated brain reactive astrogliosis, which was specifically reflected in the changes of cell morphology and the remodeling of signature molecules. Secondly, we emphasized the contribution and potential targets of reactive astrogliosis to DCI, and found that reactive astrogliosis-induced increased blood-brain barrier permeability, glymphatic system dysfunction, neuroinflammation, abnormal cell communication and cholesterol metabolism dysregulation worsened cognitive function. In addition, we summarized effective strategies for treating DCI by targeting astrocytes. Finally, we discuss the application of new techniques in astrocytes, including single-cell transcriptome, in situ sequencing, and prospected new functions, new subsets and new targets of astrocytes in DCI.
