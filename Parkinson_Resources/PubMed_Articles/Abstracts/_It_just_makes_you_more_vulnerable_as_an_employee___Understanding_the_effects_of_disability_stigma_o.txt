PMID: 37403521

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the United States, affecting approximately 1 million Americans. However, there is a dearth of research on the employment experiences of individuals with PD. This research article makes a crucial contribution to the literature by examining the role of disability stigma in shaping employment options in PD, with relevance to the experiences of adults with chronic and/or progressive diseases more broadly.
