Abstract:
The basal ganglia (BG) are involved in motor control and play an essential role in movement disorders such as hemiballismus, dystonia, and Parkinson's disease. Neurons in the motor part of the BG respond to passive movement or stimulation of different body parts and to stimulation of corresponding cortical regions. Experimental evidence suggests that the BG are organized somatotopically, i.e., specific areas of the body are associated with specific regions in the BG nuclei. Signals related to the same body part that propagate along different pathways converge onto the same BG neurons, leading to characteristic shapes of cortically evoked responses. This suggests the existence of functional channels that allow for the processing of different motor commands or information related to different body parts in parallel. Neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease are associated with pathological activity in the BG and impaired synaptic connectivity, together with reorganization of somatotopic maps. One hypothesis is that motor symptoms are, at least partly, caused by an impairment of network structure perturbing the organization of functional channels.
