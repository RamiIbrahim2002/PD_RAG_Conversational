Title: Deep Brain Stimulation for the Management of Refractory Neurological Disorders: A Comprehensive Review.
PMID: 38004040

Abstract:
In recent decades, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been extensively studied due to its reversibility and significantly fewer side effects. DBS is mainly a symptomatic therapy, but the stimulation of subcortical areas by DBS is believed to affect the cytoarchitecture of the brain, leading to adaptability and neurogenesis. The neurological disorders most commonly studied with DBS were Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major depressive disorder. The most precise approach to evaluating the location of the leads still relies on the stimulus-induced side effects reported by the patients. Moreover, the adequate voltage and DBS current field could correlate with the patient's symptoms. Implantable pulse generators are the main parts of the DBS, and their main characteristics, such as rechargeable capability, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) safety, and device size, should always be discussed with patients. The safety of MRI will depend on several parameters: the part of the body where the device is implanted, the part of the body scanned, and the MRI-tesla magnetic field. It is worth mentioning that drug-resistant individuals may have different pathophysiological explanations for their resistance to medications, which could affect the efficacy of DBS therapy. Therefore, this could explain the significant difference in the outcomes of studies with DBS in individuals with drug-resistant neurological conditions.
