PMID: 37743764

Abstract:
To investigate structural and functional connectivity changes in brain olfactory-related structures in a longitudinal prospective cohort of isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and their clinical correlations, longitudinal evolution, and predictive values for phenoconversion to overt synucleinopathies, especially Lewy body diseases.
