Title: The adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor in the basal ganglia: Expression, heteromerization, functional selectivity and signalling.
PMID: 37741696

Abstract:
Adenosine is a neuroregulatory nucleoside that acts through four G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2A</sub>, A<sub>2B</sub> and A<sub>3</sub>, which are widely expressed in cells of the nervous system. The A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R), the GPCR with the highest expression in the striatum, has a similar role to that of receptors for dopamine, one of the main neurotransmitters. Neuronal and glial A<sub>2A</sub>Rs participate in the modulation of dopaminergic transmission and act in almost any action in which the basal ganglia is involved. This chapter revisits the expression of the A<sub>2A</sub>R in the basal ganglia in health and disease, and describes the diversity of signalling depending on whether the receptors are expressed as monomer or as heteromer. The A<sub>2A</sub>R can interact with other receptors as adenosine A<sub>1</sub>, dopamine D<sub>2</sub>, or cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> to form heteromers with relevant functions in the basal ganglia. Heteromerization, with these and other GPCRs, provides diversity to A<sub>2A</sub>R-mediated signalling and to the modulation of neurotransmission. Thus, selective A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonists have neuroprotective potential acting directly on neurons, but also through modulation of glial cell activation, for example, by decreasing neuroinflammatory events that accompany neurodegenerative diseases. In fact, A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonists are safe and their potential in the therapy of Parkinson's disease has already led to the approval of one of them, istradefylline, in Japan and United States. The receptor also has a key role in reward circuits and, again, heteromers with dopamine receptors, but also with cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptors, participate in the events triggered by drugs of abuse.
