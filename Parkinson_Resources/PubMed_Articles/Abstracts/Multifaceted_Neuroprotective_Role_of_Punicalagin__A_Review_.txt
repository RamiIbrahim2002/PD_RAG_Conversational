PMID: 38085406

Abstract:
Millions of people worldwide are currently afflicted with neurologic conditions like a seizure, depression, stress, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. However, the precise etiopathology of these diseases is still unknown. Substantial studies are being conducted to discover more treatments against these disorders because many patients do not experience the therapeutic benefits that would be expected from using existing pharmaceutical strategies. Herbal medicines which have been used in traditional medicine for millennia to treat various neurological problems are also being investigated and scientifically assessed. Punicalagin is a known polyphenol that has significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-proliferative, and anti-cancer properties. Around the world, traditional use of herbal drugs is gaining wider acceptance as a part of complementary and alternative medicine. The scientific community should pay attention to these many neuroprotective pharmacodynamic activities of Punicalagin to create effective pharmacotherapeutic plans, as evidenced by mounting data in pre-clinical research investigations. The current review describes the recent studies on the pharmacological effects of Punicalagin in a variety of neurological illnesses and paves the way for further study in this field.
