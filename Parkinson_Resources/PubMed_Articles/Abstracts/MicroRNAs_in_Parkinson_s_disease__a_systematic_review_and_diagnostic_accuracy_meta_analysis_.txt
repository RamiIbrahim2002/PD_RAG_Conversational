Title: MicroRNAs in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis.
PMID: 37770507

Abstract:
Current clinical tests for Parkinson's disease (PD) provide insufficient diagnostic accuracy leading to an urgent need for improved diagnostic biomarkers. As microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising biomarkers of various diseases, including PD, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of biofluid miRNAs in PD. All studies reporting data on miRNAs expression in PD patients compared to controls were included. Gene targets and significant pathways associated with miRNAs expressed in more than 3 biofluid studies with the same direction of change were analyzed using target prediction and enrichment analysis. A bivariate model was used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratio. While miR-24-3p and miR-214-3p were the most reported miRNA (7 each), miR-331-5p was found to be consistently up regulated in 4 different biofluids. Importantly, miR-19b-3p, miR-24-3p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-221-3p were reported in multiple studies without conflicting directions of change in serum and bioinformatic analysis found the targets of these miRNAs to be associated with pathways important in PD pathology. Of the 102 studies from the systematic review, 15 studies reported sensitivity and specificity data on combinations of miRNAs and were pooled for meta-analysis. Studies (17) reporting sensitivity and specificity data on single microRNA were pooled in a separate meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of the combinations of miRNAs (15 studies) showed that biofluid miRNAs can discriminate between PD patients and controls with good diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity = 0.82, 95% CI 0.76-0.87; specificity = 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.84; AUC = 0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.89). However, we found multiple studies included more males with PD than any other group therefore possibly introducing a sex-related selection bias. Overall, our study captures key miRNAs which may represent a point of focus for future studies and the development of diagnostic panels whilst also highlighting the importance of appropriate study design to develop representative biomarker panels for the diagnosis of PD.
