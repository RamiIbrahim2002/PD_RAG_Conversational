Title: Phenotypic Profiling of Human Stem Cell-Derived Midbrain Dopaminergic Neurons.
PMID: 37486112

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is linked to a range of cell biological processes that cause midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuron loss. Many current in vitro PD cellular models lack complexity and do not take multiple phenotypes into account. Phenotypic profiling in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mDA neurons can address these shortcomings by simultaneously measuring a range of neuronal phenotypes in a PD-relevant cell type in parallel. Here, we describe a protocol to obtain and analyze phenotypic profiles from commercially available human mDA neurons. A neuron-specific fluorescent staining panel is used to visualize the nuclear, Î±-synuclein, Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) related phenotypes. The described phenotypic profiling protocol is scalable as it uses 384-well plates, automatic liquid handling and high-throughput microscopy. The utility of the protocol is exemplified using healthy donor mDA neurons and mDA neurons carrying the PD-linked G2019S mutation in the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene. Both cell lines were treated with the LRRK2 kinase inhibitor PFE-360 and phenotypic changes were measured. Additionally, we demonstrate how multidimensional phenotypic profiles can be analyzed using clustering or machine learning-driven supervised classification methods. The described protocol will particularly interest researchers working on neuronal disease modeling or studying chemical compound effects in human neurons.
