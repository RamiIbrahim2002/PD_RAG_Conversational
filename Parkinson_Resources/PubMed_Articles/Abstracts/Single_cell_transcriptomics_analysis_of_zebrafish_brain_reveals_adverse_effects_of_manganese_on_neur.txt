Title: Single-cell transcriptomics analysis of zebrafish brain reveals adverse effects of manganese on neurogenesis.
PMID: 37952916

Abstract:
Manganese (Mn) is considered as an important environmental risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Excessive exposure to Mn can damage various neural cells and affect the neurogenesis, resulting in neurological dysfunction. However, the specific mechanisms of Mn exposure affecting neurogenesis have not been well understood, including compositional changes and heterogeneity of various neural cells. Zebrafish have been successfully used as a neurotoxicity model due to its homology with mammals in several key regions of the brain, as well as its advantages such as small size. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of zebrafish brains from normal and Mn-exposed groups. Our results suggested that low levels of Mn exposure activated neurogenesis in the zebrafish brain, including promoting the proliferation of neural progenitor cells and differentiation to newborn neurons and oligodendrocytes, while high levels of Mn exposure inhibited neurogenesis and neural function. Mn could affect neurogenesis through specific molecular pathways. In addition, Mn regulated intercellular communication and affected cellular communication in neural cells through specific signaling pathways. Taken together, our study elucidates the cellular composition of the zebrafish brain and adds to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in Mn-induced neurogenesis damage.
