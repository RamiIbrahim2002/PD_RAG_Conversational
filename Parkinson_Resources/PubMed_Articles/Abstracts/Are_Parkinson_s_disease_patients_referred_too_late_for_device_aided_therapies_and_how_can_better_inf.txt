Title: Are Parkinson's disease patients referred too late for device-aided therapies and how can better informed and earlier referrals be encouraged?
PMID: 37526767

Abstract:
In the advanced Parkinson's disease, motor and non-motor symptoms become more severe and more difficult to treat. Oral therapy may become insufficient in controlling a patientÂ´s motor complications, which results in a substantial deterioration of the patient's quality of life, ability to work and self-reliance. This is when device-aided treatments should be considered and offered, if suitable for a given patient. They include subcutaneous and intestinal infusion therapies, deep brain stimulation and, more recently, MRI-guided focussed ultrasound. Device-aided treatments should be offered in accordance with guidelines and treatment standardization. Also there is a need to ensure availability of treatment and education of patients and physicians.
