Title: Amantadine toxicity causing visual hallucinations.
PMID: 37419676

Abstract:
Amantadine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor agonist with secondary dopaminergic activity that is used to treat Parkinson's disease-related dyskinesia and to treat fatigue in multiple sclerosis. It is primarily renally excreted and so impaired kidney function prolongs its half-life and may lead to toxicity. We describe a woman with multiple sclerosis taking amantadine who developed acute renal impairment, which triggered florid visual hallucinations that resolved on stopping the medication.
