Title: Zinc and Central Nervous System Disorders.
PMID: 37432243

Abstract:
Zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) is the second most abundant necessary trace element in the human body, exerting a critical role in many physiological processes such as cellular proliferation, transcription, apoptosis, growth, immunity, and wound healing. It is an essential catalyst ion for many enzymes and transcription factors. The maintenance of Zn<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is essential for the central nervous system, in which Zn<sup>2+</sup> is abundantly distributed and accumulates in presynaptic vesicles. Synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> is necessary for neural transmission, playing a pivotal role in neurogenesis, cognition, memory, and learning. Emerging data suggest that disruption of Zn<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is associated with several central nervous system disorders including Alzheimer's disease, depression, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury. Here, we reviewed the correlation between Zn<sup>2+</sup> and these central nervous system disorders. The potential mechanisms were also included. We hope that this review can provide new clues for the prevention and treatment of nervous system disorders.
