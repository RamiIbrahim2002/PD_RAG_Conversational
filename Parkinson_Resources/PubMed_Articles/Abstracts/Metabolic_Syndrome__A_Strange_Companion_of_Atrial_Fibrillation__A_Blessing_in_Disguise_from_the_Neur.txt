Title: Metabolic Syndrome: A Strange Companion of Atrial Fibrillation; A Blessing in Disguise from the Neuropsychiatric Point of View.
PMID: 37509651

Abstract:
<b>Background:</b> The concept of metabolic syndrome (MetSy) brings together components that individually represent a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, which over time can prove to be more harmful if a combined effect of these is exhibited. <b>Method</b>: A single-centre retrospective study in an academic medical unit was conducted. We analysed the link between the MetSy and the occurrence of neuropsychic complications among atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. We sifted through the files of the patients admitted during 2015-2016 to the Municipal Emergency University Hospital Timisoara, Romania, with the diagnosis of AF. We divided these AF patients into two groups: the first group comprised patients with atrial fibrillation and MetSy (267 patients), while the second group comprised AF patients without MetSy (843 patients). We analysed the occurrence of neuropsychic changes (stroke, Parkinson's disease, dementia, cognitive impairment, and silent lacunar infarction) among the two groups. <b>Results</b>: Cognitive impairment (<i>p</i>-value = 0.0081) and dementia (<i>p</i>-value < 0.0001) were less frequent in patients with AF and MetSy than in those with AF without MetSy. Regarding the presence of stroke and Parkinson's disease (PD), we could not demonstrate the existence of any statistically significant difference between the two groups. Using logistic regression (enter test), we found that MetSy might have a protective effect (OR = 0.4040, 95% CI [0.2132; 0.7654], <i>p</i>-value = 0.0054) for the occurrence of dementia in those patients. Furthermore, obesity was the only factor with a possible protective effect from all the constituents of the MetSy when analysed together (with a significance level of <i>p</i>-value = 0.0004 for the logistic regression). The protective effect of MetSy against stroke occurrence was supplementarily proven by a longer period of survival without stroke from the AF diagnosis (3.521 years, <i>p</i> = 0.0304) compared to patients with AF without MetSy (3.286 years to first stroke occurrence). <b>Conclusions</b>: Metabolic syndrome might offer protection against the occurrence of dementia among patients with AF, but no effect was noted when compared with the presence of stroke. Further studies on larger cohorts can help us reach a conclusion regarding the positive effects of the metabolic syndrome.
