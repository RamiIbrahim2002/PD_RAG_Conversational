Title: Recombinant human HspB5-ACD structural domain inhibits neurotoxicity by regulating pathological α-Syn aggregation.
PMID: 37992927

Abstract:
The treatment of Parkinson's disease is a global medical challenge. α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is the causative protein in Parkinson's disease and is closely linked to its progression. Therefore, inhibiting the pathological aggregation of α-Syn and its neurotoxicity is essential for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In this study, α-Syn and recombinant human HspB5-ACD structural domain protein (AHspB5) were produced using the BL21(DE3) E. coli prokaryotic expression system, and then the role and mechanism of AHspB5 in inhibiting the pathological aggregation of α-Syn and its neurotoxicity were investigated. As a result, we expressed α-Syn and AHspB5 proteins and characterised the proteins. In vitro experiments showed that AHspB5 could inhibit the formation of α-Syn oligomers and fibrils; in cellular experiments, AHspB5 could prevent α-Syn-induced neuronal cell dysfunction, oxidative stress damage and apoptosis, and its mechanism of action was related to the TH-DA pathway and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway; in animal experiments, AHspB5 could inhibit behavioural abnormalities, oxidative stress damage and loss of dopaminergic neurons. In conclusion, this work is expected to elucidate the mechanism and biological effects of AHspB5 on the pathological aggregation of α-Syn, providing a new pathway for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and laying the foundation for recombinant AHspB5.
