Title: Alpha-synuclein fibrils amplified from multiple system atrophy and Parkinson's disease patient brain spread after intracerebral injection into mouse brain.
PMID: 37485772

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are neurodegenerative disorders with alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation pathology. Different strains of α-syn with unique properties are suggested to cause distinct clinical and pathological manifestations resulting in PD, MSA, or DLB. To study individual α-syn spreading patterns, we injected α-syn fibrils amplified from brain homogenates of two MSA patients and two PD patients into the brains of C57BI6/J mice. Antibody staining against pS129-α-syn showed that α-syn fibrils amplified from the brain homogenates of the four different patients caused different levels of α-syn spreading. The strongest α-syn pathology was triggered by α-syn fibrils of one of the two MSA patients, followed by comparable pS129-α-syn induction by the second MSA and one PD patient material. Histological analysis using an antibody against Iba1 further showed that the formation of pS129-α-syn is associated with increased microglia activation. In contrast, no differences in dopaminergic neuron numbers or co-localization of α-syn in oligodendrocytes were observed between the different groups. Our data support the spreading of α-syn pathology in MSA, while at the same time pointing to spreading heterogeneity between different patients potentially driven by individual patient immanent factors.
