PMID: 37474673

Abstract:
First, to investigate the patterns of [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDOPA positron emission tomography imaging in corticobasal syndrome using visual and semi-quantitative analysis and to compare them with patterns found in Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Then, to search for correlations with clinical features and [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG positron emission tomography imaging.
