Title: Genomic profile of Parkinson's disease in Asians.
PMID: 38016627

Abstract:
Parkinson's Disease (PD) has witnessed an alarming rise in prevalence, highlighting the suboptimal nature of early diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. To address this issue, genetic testing has emerged as a potential avenue. In this comprehensive review, we have meticulously summarized the variants associated with PD in Asian populations. Our review reveals that these variants exert their influence on diverse biological pathways, encompassing the autophagy-lysosome pathway, cholesterol metabolism, circadian rhythm regulation, immune system response, and synaptic function. Conventionally, PD has been linked to other diseases; however, our findings shed light on a shared genetic susceptibility among these conditions, implying an underlying pathophysiological mechanism that unifies them. Moreover, it is noteworthy that these PD-associated variants can significantly impact drug responses during therapeutic interventions. This review not only provides a consolidated overview of the genetic variants associated with PD in Asian populations but also contributes novel insights into the intricate relationships between PD and other diseases by elucidating shared genetic components. These findings underscore the importance of personalized approaches in diagnosing and treating PD based on individual genetic profiles to optimize patient outcomes.
