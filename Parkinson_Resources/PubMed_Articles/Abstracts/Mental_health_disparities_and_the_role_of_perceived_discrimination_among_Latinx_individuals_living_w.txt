Title: Mental health disparities and the role of perceived discrimination among Latinx individuals living with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37802014

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with motor and non-motor symptoms including depression and cognitive impairment. There is underrepresentation of Latinxs in PD research as most of the research consists of non-Latinx white participants. The current study investigates longitudinal differences in health disparities among Latinx and White non-Latinx individuals living with PD. As a second aim, we examined the associations between perceived discrimination in healthcare and outcomes from aim 1.
