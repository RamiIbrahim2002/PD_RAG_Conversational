PMID: 38176256

Abstract:
Point-of-care testing (POCT) for low-concentration protein biomarkers remains challenging due to limitations in biosensor sensitivity and platform integration. This study addresses this gap by presenting a novel approach that integrates a metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) biosensor within a capillary flow-driven microfluidic cartridge (CFMC) for the ultrasensitive detection of the Parkinson's disease biomarker, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex interacting multi-functional protein 2 (AIMP-2). Crucial point to this approach is the orientation-controlled immobilization of capture antibody on a nanodimple-structured MEF substrate within the CFMC. This strategy significantly enhances fluorescence signals without quenching, enabling accurate quantification of low-concentration AIMP-2 using a simple digital fluorescence microscope with a light-emitting diode excitation source and a digital camera. The resulting platform exhibits exceptional sensitivity, achieving a limit of detection in the pg/mL range for AIMP-2 in human serum. Additionally, the CFMC design incorporates a capillary-driven passive sample transport mechanism, eliminating the need for external pumps and further simplifying the detection process. Overall, this work demonstrates the successful integration of MEF biosensing with capillary microfluidics for point-of-care applications.
