Title: Uric acid and glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PMID: 37575992

Abstract:
Glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness, is a common disorder that contributes to gradual optic nerve degeneration. The beneficial impacts of uric acid (UA) have been reported in some neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. But the results of current studies about the association between serum UA level and glaucoma are conflicting. The present meta-analysis was conducted to provide a better understanding of the association between serum UA level and glaucoma.
