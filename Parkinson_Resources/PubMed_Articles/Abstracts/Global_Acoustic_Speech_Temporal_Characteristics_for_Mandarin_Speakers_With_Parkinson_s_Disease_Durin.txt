PMID: 37625136

Abstract:
Previous research has revealed considerable variation in speech rates among English speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD) with slower, faster, or similar rates than controls. The purpose of this study was to characterize speech rates of Mandarin speakers with PD and the corresponding articulation and pause characteristics explaining the speech rates to enhance rate control therapies.
