Title: Large Sigmoid Fecaloma: A Rare Case of a Common Condition in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37790016

Abstract:
A fecaloma is a rare complication of chronic constipation that is more commonly seen in elderly individuals with chronic neuropsychiatric disorders. We present the case of a 79-year-old patient with Parkinson's disease with refractory constipation due to a large fecaloma mass in the sigmoid colon, which is a rare sequela of poorly managed chronic constipation. The current report highlights the importance of aggressive medical therapy for chronic constipation in this group of patients to prevent life-threatening complications.
