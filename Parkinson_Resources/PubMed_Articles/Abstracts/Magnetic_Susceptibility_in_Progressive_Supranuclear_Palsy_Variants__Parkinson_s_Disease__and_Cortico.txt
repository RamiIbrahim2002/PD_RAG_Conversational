Title: Magnetic Susceptibility in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Variants, Parkinson's Disease, and Corticobasal Syndrome.
PMID: 37772771

Abstract:
Previous studies have shown that magnetic susceptibility is increased in several subcortical regions in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). However, it is still unclear how subcortical and cortical susceptibilities vary across different PSP variants, Parkinson's disease (PD), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS).
