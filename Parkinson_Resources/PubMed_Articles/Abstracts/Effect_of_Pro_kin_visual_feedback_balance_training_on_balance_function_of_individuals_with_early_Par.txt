Title: Effect of Pro-kin visual feedback balance training on balance function of individuals with early Parkinson's disease: a randomized controlled pilot trial.
PMID: 38223579

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Patients often present with balance dysfunction. Several studies have applied visual feedback training to stroke patients and demonstrated significant improvement. However, the application of visual feedback balance training in PD patients has not been reported.
