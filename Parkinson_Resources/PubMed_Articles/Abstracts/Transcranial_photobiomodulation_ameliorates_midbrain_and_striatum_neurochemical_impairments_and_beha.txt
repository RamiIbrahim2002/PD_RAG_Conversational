Title: Transcranial photobiomodulation ameliorates midbrain and striatum neurochemical impairments and behavioral deficits in reserpine-induced parkinsonism in rats.
PMID: 37917308

Abstract:
Photobiomodulation (PBM) of deep brain structures through transcranial infrared irradiation might be an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanisms underlying this intervention should be elucidated to optimize the therapeutic outcome and maximize therapeutic efficacy. The present study aimed at investigating the oxidative stress-related parameters of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and reduced glutathione (GSH) and the enzymatic activities of sodium-potassium-ATPase (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase), Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) and monoamine levels (dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) in the midbrain and striatum of reserpine-induced PD in an animal model treated with PBM. Furthermore, the locomotor behavior of the animals has been determined by the open field test. Animals were divided into three groups; the control group, the PD-induced model group, and the PD-induced model treated with the PBM group. Non-invasive treatment of animals for 14 days with 100 mW, 830 nm laser has demonstrated successful attainment in the recovery of oxidative stress, and enzymatic activities impairments induced by reserpine (0.2 mg/kg) in both midbrain and striatum of adult male Wistar rats. PBM also improved the decrease in DA, NE, and 5-HT in the investigated brain regions. On a behavioral level, animals showed improvement in their locomotion activity. These findings have shed more light on some mechanisms underlying the treatment potential of PBM and displayed the safety, easiness, and efficacy of PBM treatment as an alternative to pharmacological treatment for PD.
