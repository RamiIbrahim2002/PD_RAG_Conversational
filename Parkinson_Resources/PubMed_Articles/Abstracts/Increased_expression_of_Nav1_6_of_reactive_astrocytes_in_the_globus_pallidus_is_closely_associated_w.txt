Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in elderly people, which is characterized by motor disabilities in PD patients. Nav1.6 is the most abundant subtype of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) in the brain of adult mammals and rodents. Here we investigated the role of Nav1.6 in the external globus pallidus (GP) involved in the pathogenesis of motor deficits in unilateral 6-OHDA(6-hydroxydopamine)lesioned rats. The results show that Nav1.6 is dramatically increased in reactive astrocytes of the ipsilateral GP in the middle stage, but not different from the control rats in the later stage of the pathological process in 6-OHDA lesioned rats. Furthermore, the down-regulation of Nav1.6 expression in the ipsilateral GP can significantly improve motor deficits in 6-OHDA lesioned rats in the middle stage of the pathological process. The electrophysiological experiments show that the down-regulation of Nav1.6 expression in the ipsilateral GP significantly decreases the abnormal high synchronization between the ipsilateral M1 (the primary motor cortex) and GP in 6-OHDA lesioned rats. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging reveals that the down-regulation of Nav1.6 expression reduces the intracellular concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]i) in primary cultured astrocytes. These findings suggest that the increased Nav1.6 expression of reactive astrocytes in the GP play an important role in the pathogenesis of motor dysfunction in the middle stage in 6-OHDA lesioned rats, which may participate in astrocyte-neuron communication by regulating [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]i of astrocytes, thereby contributing to the formation of abnormal electrical signals of the basal ganglia (BG) in 6-OHDA lesioned rats.
