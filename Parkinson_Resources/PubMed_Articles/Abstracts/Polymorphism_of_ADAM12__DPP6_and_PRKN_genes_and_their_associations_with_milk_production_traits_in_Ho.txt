PMID: 37917556

Abstract:
Milk production traits as the most important economic traits of dairy cows, they directly reflect the benefits of breeding and the economic benefits of pasture. In this study, A disintegrin and metalloproteinase-12 (ADAM12), Parkinson's disease gene 2 (PRKN) and dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein subtype 6 (DPP6) polymorphism in 384 Chinese Holstein cows were detected by time-of-flight mass spectrometry and through statistical analysis using software such as Popgene 32, SAS 9.4 and Origin 2022, the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of three genes with four milk production traits such as daily milk yield (DMY), milk fat percentage (MFP), milk protein percentage (MPP) and somatic cell score (SCS) was verified at molecular level. The results showed that four polymorphic loci (116,467,133, 116,604,487, 116,618,268 and 116,835,111) of DPP6 gene, two polymorphic loci (97,665,052 and 97,159,837) of PRKN gene and two polymorphic loci (45,542,714 and 45,553,888) of ADAM12 gene were detected. PRKN-97665052, DPP6-116467133, ADAM12-45553888, DPP6-116604487 and DPP6-116835111 were all in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium state (p > .05). ADAM12-45542714, PRKN-97159837 and PRKN-97665052 were moderately polymorphic (0.25 ≤ PIC <0.50) in Holstein. It is evident that the selection potential and genetic variation of these five loci are relatively large, and the genetic richness is relatively high. The correlation analysis of different genotypes between these eight loci and milk production traits of Holstein showed that ADAM12-45542714 and DPP6-116835111 (p < .01) had an extremely significant effects on the DMY of Chinese Holstein in Ningxia, while PRKN-97665052 had an extremely significant effect on MFP (p < .01). The effect of PRKN-97665052 and DPP6-116467133 on MPP of Holstein were extremely significant (p < .01). DPP6-116618268 had an extremely significant effect on the SCS of Holstein in Ningxia (p < .01), and AA genotype individuals showed a higher SCS than GG genotype individuals; the other two loci (ADAM12-45553888 and DPP6-116604487) had no significant effects on milk production traits of Holstein (p > .05). In addition, through the joint analysis of DPP6, PRKN and ADAM12 gene loci, it was found that the interaction effect between the three gene loci could significantly affect the DMY, SCS (p < .01) and MPP (p < .05). In conclusion, several different loci of DPP6, PRKN and ADAM12 genes can affect the milk production traits of Holstein to different degrees. PRKN, DPP6 and ADAM12 genes can be used as potential candidate genes for milk production traits of Holstein for marker-assisted selection, providing theoretical basis for breeding of Holstein.
