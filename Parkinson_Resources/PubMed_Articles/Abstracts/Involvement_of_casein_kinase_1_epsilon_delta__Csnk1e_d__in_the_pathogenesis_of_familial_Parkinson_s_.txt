Title: Involvement of casein kinase 1 epsilon/delta (Csnk1e/d) in the pathogenesis of familial Parkinson's disease caused by CHCHD2.
PMID: 37578019

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that results from the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Mutations in coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2) gene cause a familial form of PD with α-Synuclein aggregation, and we here identified the pathogenesis of the T61I mutation, the most common disease-causing mutation of CHCHD2. In Neuro2a cells, CHCHD2 is in mitochondria, whereas the T61I mutant (CHCHD2<sup>T61I</sup> ) is mislocalized in the cytosol. CHCHD2<sup>T61l</sup> then recruits casein kinase 1 epsilon/delta (Csnk1e/d), which phosphorylates neurofilament and α-Synuclein, forming cytosolic aggresomes. In vivo, both Chchd2<sup>T61I</sup> knock-in and transgenic mice display neurodegenerative phenotypes and aggresomes containing Chchd2<sup>T61I</sup> , Csnk1e/d, phospho-α-Synuclein, and phospho-neurofilament in their dopaminergic neurons. Similar aggresomes were observed in a postmortem PD patient brain and dopaminergic neurons generated from patient-derived iPS cells. Importantly, a Csnk1e/d inhibitor substantially suppressed the phosphorylation of neurofilament and α-Synuclein. The Csnk1e/d inhibitor also suppressed the cellular damage in CHCHD2<sup>T61I</sup> -expressing Neuro2a cells and dopaminergic neurons generated from patient-derived iPS cells and improved the neurodegenerative phenotypes of Chchd2<sup>T61I</sup> mutant mice. These results indicate that Csnk1e/d is involved in the pathogenesis of PD caused by the CHCHD2<sup>T61I</sup> mutation.
