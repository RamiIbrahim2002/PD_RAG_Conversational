Title: Role of expectations in clinical outcomes after deep brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease: a systematic review.
PMID: 37517038

Abstract:
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established treatment that significantly improves the motor symptoms of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD); however, patients may experience post-operative psychological distress and social maladjustments. This phenomenon has been shown to be related to patients' pre-operative cognitive representations, such as expectations. In this systematic review, we discuss the findings on the role of the expectations of patients with PD regarding the clinical outcomes of DBS to identify areas of intervention to improve pre-operative patient education and promote successful post-operative psychosocial adjustment. PubMed was searched for relevant articles published up to 16 January 2023. Of the 84 identified records, 10 articles focusing on the treatment expectations of patients with PD undergoing DBS were included in this review. The selected studies were conducted among cohorts of patients with different DBS targets, among which the most common was the bilateral subthalamic nucleus. Overall, the data showed that patients' expectations contribute to treatment efficacy. Experiments investigating the placebo effect itself have shown clinical improvement after the induction of positive therapeutic expectations; conversely, unrealistic treatment expectations can affect patient satisfaction after surgery, clinical outcomes, and subjective well-being. This review highlights the need for routine clinical practice to better investigate and manage patients' pre-operative expectations, as well as multidisciplinary education to improve patient satisfaction and psychosocial adjustment after DBS.
