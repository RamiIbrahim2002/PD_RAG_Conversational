Title: Cognitive dysfunction in de novo Parkinson disease: Remitting vs. progressive cognitive impairment.
PMID: 38198926

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibits divergent cognitive trajectories; however, the factors contributing to these variations remain elusive. This study aimed to examine the clinical features of patients with different long-term cognitive trajectories in de novo PD over a five-year follow-up.
