Title: The Enigmatic CA2: Exploring the Understudied Region of the Hippocampus and Its Involvement in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37509636

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects both motor and non-motor functions. Although motor impairment is a prominent clinical sign of PD, additional neurological symptoms may also occur, particularly in the preclinical and prodromal stages. Among these symptoms, social cognitive impairment is common and detrimental. This article aims to review non-motor symptoms in PD patients, focusing on social cognitive deficits. It also examines the specific characteristics of the CA2 region and its involvement in social behavior, highlighting recent advances and perspectives. Additionally, this review provides critical insights into and analysis of research conducted in rodents and humans, which may help improve the understanding of the current status of putative therapeutic strategies for social cognitive dysfunction in PD and potential avenues related to the function of the hippocampal CA2 region.
