Title: Gut microbiota bridges the iron homeostasis and host health.
PMID: 37515687

Abstract:
The gut microbiota acts as a symbiotic microecosystem that plays an indispensable role in the regulation of a number of metabolic processes in the host by secreting secondary metabolites and impacting the physiology and pathophysiology of numerous organs and tissues through the circulatory system. This relationship, referred to as the "gut-X axis", is associated with the development and progression of disorders, including obesity, fatty liver and Parkinson's disease. Given its importance, the gut flora is a vital research area for the understanding and development of the novel therapeutic approaches for multiple disorders. Iron is a common but necessary element required by both mammals and bacteria. As a result, iron metabolism is closely intertwined with the gut microbiota. The host's iron homeostasis affects the composition of the gut microbiota and the interaction between host and gut microbiota through various mechanisms such as nutrient homeostasis, intestinal peaceability, gut immunity, and oxidative stress. Therefore, understanding the relationship between gut microbes and host iron metabolism is not only of enormous significance to host health but also may offer preventative and therapeutic approaches for a number of disorders that impact both parties. In this review, we delve into the connection between the dysregulation of iron metabolism and dysbiosis of gut microbiota, and how it contributes to the onset and progression of metabolic and chronic diseases.
