Title: Treatment of Postoperative Instability Following Total Knee Arthroplasty in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 38229869

Abstract:
Acute postoperative posterior total knee arthroplasty (TKA) dislocation is rare in primary surgery but has been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). We present a 77-year-old woman with knee arthritis and PD who sustained an acute, recurrent TKA posterior dislocation, recalcitrant to polyethylene upsizing. Transient stability was obtained for a period of 1 year after postoperative hamstring injection with botulinum toxin A and short-term immobilization. Spontaneous instability recurred after 1 year, and stability was obtained with revision to a more constrained construct and has been monitored over a period of 2 years. This is the first report demonstrating the use of botulinum toxin A for acute posterior TKA instability associated with PD. We endorse the necessity of increased constraint to maintain long-term stability in patients with Parkinson's disease.
