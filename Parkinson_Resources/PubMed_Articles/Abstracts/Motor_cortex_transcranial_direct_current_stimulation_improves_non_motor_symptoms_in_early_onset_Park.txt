Title: Motor cortex transcranial direct current stimulation improves non-motor symptoms in early-onset Parkinson's disease: a pilot study.
PMID: 38104296

Abstract:
Early-onset Parkinson's Disease (EOPD) demands tailored treatments. The younger age of patients might account for a higher sensitivity to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) based non-invasive neuromodulation, which may raise as an integrative therapy in the field. Accordingly, here we assessed the safety and efficacy of the primary left motor cortex (M1) anodal tDCS in EOPD. Ten idiopathic EOPD patients received tDCS at 2.0 mA per 20 min for 10 days within a crossover, double-blind, sham-controlled pilot study. The outcome was evaluated by measuring changes in MDS-UPDRS part III, Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), PD-cognitive rating scale, and PD Quality of Life Questionnaire-39 scores. We showed that anodal but not sham tDCS significantly reduced the NMSS total and "item 2" (sleep/fatigue) scores. Other parameters were not modified. No adverse events occurred. M1 anodal tDCS might thus evoke plasticity changes in cortical-subcortical circuits involved in non-motor functions, supporting the value as a therapeutic option in EOPD.
