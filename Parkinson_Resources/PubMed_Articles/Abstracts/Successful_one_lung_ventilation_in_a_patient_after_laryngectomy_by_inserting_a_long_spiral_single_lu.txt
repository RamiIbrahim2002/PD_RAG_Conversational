Title: Successful one-lung ventilation in a patient after laryngectomy by inserting a long spiral single-lumen tube into the left main bronchus: a case report.
PMID: 38234342

Abstract:
Patients who have had laryngectomy require a thorough preoperative assessment for potential stomal stenosis, and an action plan for possible inadvertent displacement of the voice prosthesis (VP) must be considered. We report the anesthetic management of a post-laryngectomy patient undergoing lung resection surgery. The patient had both a laryngectomy and a VP <i>in situ</i>.
