Title: The Role of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in Neurodegeneration.
PMID: 37456463

Abstract:
Sirtuins (SIRT) are a class of histone deacetylases that regulate important metabolic pathways and play a role in several disease processes. Of the seven mammalian homologs currently identified, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is the best understood and most studied. It has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. As such, it has been further investigated as a therapeutic target in the treatment of disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). SIRT1 deacetylates histones such as H1 lysine 26, H3 lysine 9, H3 lysine 56, and H4 lysine 16 to regulate chromatin remodeling and gene transcription. The homolog has also been observed to express contradictory responses to tumor suppression and tumor promotion. Studies have shown that SIRT1 may have anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting the effects of NF-ÎºB, as well as stimulating upregulation of autophagy. The SIRT1 activators resveratrol and cilostazol have been shown to improve Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores in AD patients. In this review, we aim to explore the various roles of SIRT1 with regard to neuroprotection and neurodegeneration.
