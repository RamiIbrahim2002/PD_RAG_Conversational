Title: Physical exercise for treating non-motor symptoms assessed by general Parkinson's disease scales: systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials.
PMID: 37808516

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder that also manifests non-motor symptoms (NMS). Physical exercise is a prominent strategy that can have an impact on NMS; however, the evidence is limited. Our aim was to verify the effects of exercise on NMS, as assessed using general NMS scales.
