Title: Neuroplasticity in levodopa-induced dyskinesias: An overview on pathophysiology and therapeutic targets.
PMID: 38040324

Abstract:
Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) are a common complication in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). A complex cascade of electrophysiological and molecular events that induce aberrant plasticity in the cortico-basal ganglia system plays a key role in the pathophysiology of LIDs. In the striatum, multiple neurotransmitters regulate the different forms of physiological synaptic plasticity to provide it in a bidirectional and Hebbian manner. In PD, impairment of both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) progresses with disease and dopaminergic denervation of striatum. The altered balance between LTP and LTD processes leads to unidirectional changes in plasticity that cause network dysregulation and the development of involuntary movements. These alterations have been documented, in both experimental models and PD patients, not only in deep brain structures but also at motor cortex. Invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation treatments, as deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, or transcranial direct current stimulation, may provide strategies to modulate the aberrant plasticity in the cortico-basal ganglia network of patients affected by LIDs, thus restoring normal neurophysiological functioning and treating dyskinesias. In this review, we discuss the evidence for neuroplasticity impairment in experimental PD models and in patients affected by LIDs, and potential neuromodulation strategies that may modulate aberrant plasticity.
