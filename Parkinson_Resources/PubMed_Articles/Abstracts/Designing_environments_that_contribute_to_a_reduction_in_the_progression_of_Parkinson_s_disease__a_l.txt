Title: Designing environments that contribute to a reduction in the progression of Parkinson's disease; a literature review.
PMID: 37703785

Abstract:
Parkinson's Disease (PD), a prevalent neurological disorder, causes physical difficulties like stiffness and impaired walking and affects patients' emotional well-being. Regular exercise and exposure to enriched environments are crucial to managing these symptoms. This review aims to extract evidence from studies regarding built environments' impact on reducing the progression of PD. Keywords from 2005 to 2022 were used in five databases, including PubMed, Clarivate Web of Science, UGA Library, and Google Scholar. Many studies emphasized physiotherapy and training for physical enhancement, often utilizing virtual games and smart devices. Others highlighted the advantages of non-slip flooring and accessible outdoor spaces, with some based on universal design principles. Few studies considered the emotional impact of built environments, showing a considerable gap in the studies simultaneously evaluating psychological and physical perspectives of Parkinson-friendly environments. There needs to be more consistency when considering these aspects of planning. Our findings suggest future research modeling enriched environments and tracking their impact on patients via Virtual Reality to find a comprehensive guideline for the most effective PD management environments.
