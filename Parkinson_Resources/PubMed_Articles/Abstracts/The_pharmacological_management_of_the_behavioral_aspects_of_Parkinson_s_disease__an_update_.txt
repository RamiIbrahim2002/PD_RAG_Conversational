Title: The pharmacological management of the behavioral aspects of Parkinson's disease: an update.
PMID: 37493445

Abstract:
Behavioural symptoms are common manifestations of Parkinson's disease and include depression, anxiety, impulse control disorders, hallucinations, psychosis, and cognitive dysfunction. They remain inadequately addressed in many patients despite their relevance for quality of life and disability. This applies also to impulse control disorders where the most common approach in recent literature is to refrain from using dopamine agonists without consideration about their potential benefit on motor complications.
