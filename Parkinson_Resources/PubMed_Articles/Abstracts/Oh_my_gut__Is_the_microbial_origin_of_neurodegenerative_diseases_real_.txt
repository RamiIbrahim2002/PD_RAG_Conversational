Title: Oh my gut! Is the microbial origin of neurodegenerative diseases real?
PMID: 37750713

Abstract:
There is no cure or effective treatment for neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases (PCDs), such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, mainly because the etiology of these diseases remains elusive. Recent data suggest that unique changes in the gut microbial composition are associated with these ailments; however, our current understanding of the bacterial role in the pathogenesis of PCDs is hindered by the complexity of the microbial communities associated with specific microbiomes, such as the gut, oral, or vaginal microbiota. The composition of these specific microbiomes is regarded as a unique fingerprint affected by factors such as infections, diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics. All of these factors also affect the severity of neurodegenerative diseases. The majority of studies that reveal microbial contribution are correlational, and various models, including worm, fly, and mouse, are being utilized to decipher the role of individual microbes that may affect disease onset and progression. Recent evidence from across model organisms and humans shows a positive correlation between the presence of gram-negative enteropathogenic bacteria and the pathogenesis of PCDs. While these correlational studies do not provide a mechanistic explanation, they do reveal contributing bacterial species and provide an important basis for further investigation. One of the lurking concerns related to the microbial contribution to PCDs is the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance and poor antibiotic stewardship, which ultimately select for proteotoxic bacteria, especially the gram-negative species that are known for intrinsic resistance. In this review, we summarize what is known about individual microbial contribution to PCDs and the potential impact of increasing antimicrobial resistance.
