Title: Gender-aware Parkinson's care: a design-based study of patient perspectives on gender norms and gender-sensitive care.
PMID: 37876997

Abstract:
Gender dimensions are progressively recognised as a relevant social determinant of health in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, little is known about the impact of gender norms and stereotypes on illness experiences of men and women with PD and what they consider important focal points for gender-sensitive PD care.
