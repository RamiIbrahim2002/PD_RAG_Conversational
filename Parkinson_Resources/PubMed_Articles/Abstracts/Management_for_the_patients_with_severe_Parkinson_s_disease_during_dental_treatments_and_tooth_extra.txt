PMID: 38303822

Abstract:
When Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses, oral and swallowing functions decline, and special care is necessary when performing dental treatments. This study aimed to retrospectively investigate the records of patients with PD and analyze dental and general problems to establish countermeasures during dental treatments.
