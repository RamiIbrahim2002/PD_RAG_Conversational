Title: Gait initiation in Parkinson's disease: comparison of timing and displacement during anticipatory postural adjustments as a function of motor severity and apathy in a large cohort.
PMID: 38230232

Abstract:
Gait initiation is preceded by three anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) phases. In Parkinson's disease (PD) generated force, displacement and timing during APA differ from healthy controls. APA might be influenced by disease status, weight or emotion. It is unknown how motor severity, disease duration or presence of apathy influences APA timing and displacement.
