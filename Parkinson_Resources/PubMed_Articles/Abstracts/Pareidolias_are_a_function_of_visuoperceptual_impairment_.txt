Title: Pareidolias are a function of visuoperceptual impairment.
PMID: 37930972

Abstract:
Pareidolias, or the misperception of ambiguous stimuli as meaningful objects, are complex visual illusions thought to be phenomenologically similar to Visual Hallucination (VH). VH are a major predictor of dementia in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and are included as a core clinical feature in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). A newly developed Noise Pareidolia Test (NPT) was proposed as a possible surrogate marker for VH in DLB patients as increased pareidolic responses correlated with informant-corroborated accounts of VH. This association could, however, be mediated by visuoperceptual impairment. To understand the drivers of performance on the NPT, we contrasted performances in patient groups that varied both in terms of visuoperceptual ability and rates of VH. N = 43 patients were studied of whom n = 13 had DLB or PD with Dementia (PDD); n = 13 had PD; n = 12 had typical, memory-onset Alzheimer's Disease (tAD); and n = 5 had Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) due to Alzheimer's disease. All patient groups reported pareidolias. Within the Lewy body disorders (PD, DLB, PDD), there was no significant difference in pareidolic response rates between hallucinating and non-hallucinating patients. Visuoperceptual deficits and pareidolic responses were most frequent in the PCA group-none of whom reported VH. Regression analyses in the entire patient cohort indicated that pareidolias were strongly predicted by visuoperceptual impairment but not by the presence of VH. These findings suggest that pareidolias reflect the underlying visuoperceptual impairment of Lewy body disorders, rather than being a direct marker for VH.
