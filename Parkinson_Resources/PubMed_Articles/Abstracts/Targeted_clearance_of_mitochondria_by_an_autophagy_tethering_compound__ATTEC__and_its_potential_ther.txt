Title: Targeted clearance of mitochondria by an autophagy-tethering compound (ATTEC) and its potential therapeutic effects.
PMID: 37940449

Abstract:
Increased mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in many neurodegeneration-related diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Down syndrome (DS). Thus, enhancement of mitochondrial degradation by small molecule compounds may provide promising new strategies to tackle these diseases. Here, we explored the strategy to induce clearance of mitochondria by targeting them to the autophagy machinery by autophagy-tethering compounds (ATTECs). We provided the proof-of-concept evidence demonstrating that the bifunctional compound (mT1) binding to both the outer mitochondrial membrane protein TSPO and the autophagosome protein LC3B simultaneously may enhance the engulfment of damaged mitochondria by autophagosomes and subsequent autophagic degradation of them. In addition, preliminary experiments suggest that mT1 attenuated disease-relevant phenotypes in both a PD cellular model and a DS organoid model. Taken together, we demonstrate the possibility of degrading mitochondria by bifunctional ATTECs, which confirms the capability of degrading organelles by ATTECs and provides potential new strategies in the intervention of mitochondria-related disorders.
