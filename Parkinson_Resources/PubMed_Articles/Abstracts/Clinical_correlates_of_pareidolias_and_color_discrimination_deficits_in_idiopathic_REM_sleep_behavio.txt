Title: Clinical correlates of pareidolias and color discrimination deficits in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder and Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38110521

Abstract:
Visuoperceptual dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and is also reported in its prodromal phase, isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). We aimed to investigate color discrimination ability and complex visual illusions known as pareidolias in patients with iRBD and PD compared to healthy controls, and their associating clinical factors. 46 iRBD, 43 PD, and 64 healthy controls performed the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test and noise pareidolia tests. Any relationship between those two visual functions and associations with prodromal motor and non-motor manifestations were evaluated, including MDS-UPDRS part I to III, Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test, sleep questionnaires, and comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. iRBD and PD patients both performed worse on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test and had greater number of pareidolias compared to healthy controls. No correlations were found between the extent of impaired color discrimination and pareidolia scores in either group. In iRBD patients, pareidolias were associated with frontal executive dysfunction, while impaired color discrimination was associated with visuospatial dysfunction, hyposmia, and higher MDS-UPDRS-III scores. Pareidolias in PD patients correlated with worse global cognition, whereas color discrimination deficits were associated with frontal executive dysfunction. Color discrimination deficits and pareidolias are frequent but does not correlate with each other from prodromal to clinically established stage of PD. The different pattern of clinical associates with the two visual symptoms suggests that evaluation of both color and pareidolias may aid in revealing the course of neurodegeneration in iRBD and PD patients.
