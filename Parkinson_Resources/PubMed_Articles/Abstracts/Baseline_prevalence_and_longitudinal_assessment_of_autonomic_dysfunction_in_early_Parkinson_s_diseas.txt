Title: Baseline prevalence and longitudinal assessment of autonomic dysfunction in early Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37923936

Abstract:
Autonomic dysfunction (AutD) is common and debilitating in Parkinson's disease (PD). Predictors of AutD are unclear, and data are limited on the biological relevance of AutD in PD. Here, we evaluated the baseline prevalence and 2-year longitudinal assessment of AutD in patients with de novo PD compared with healthy controls (HC). Moreover, we also assessed various variables that could predict longitudinal changes in AutD in early PD. Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) was utilized to evaluate untreated PD participants at baseline and HC. Autonomic function was assessed using the 25-item Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT) score at baseline and 2 years. Clinical and biological variables were measured for their correlations with AuD for up to 2 years. Two hundred and ninety PD subjects and 170 HC were enrolled and followed for 2 years. SCOPA-AUT mean (SD) scores increased from baseline 8.49 ± 5.23 to 10.12 ± 5.77 at year 2 in PD subjects (p < 0.001) versus from 4.98 ± 3.34 to 5.03 ± 374 in HC (p = 0.496), with a significant difference between the groups (p < 0.001). Among them, 242 PD participants and 151 HC completed the SCOPA-AUT assessment, including sexual function. In the multivariate analysis, a higher baseline SCOPA-AUT score was associated with higher baseline MDS-UPDRS Part I scores (p < 0.001). Moreover, a longitudinal increase in autonomic function severity was associated with the white race (p = 0.010) at baseline. In contrast, there was no association with the CSF biomarkers. MDS-UPDRS Part I score may predict AuD in patients with early PD, which is correlated with nonmotor symptoms and race.
