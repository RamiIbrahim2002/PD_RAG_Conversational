Title: Correlation of brain iron deposition and freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease: a cross-sectional study.
PMID: 38106290

Abstract:
Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a novel imaging method for detecting iron content in the brain. The study aimed determine whether the iron deposition in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is correlated with freezing of gait (FOG).
