Title: Screening of Crucial Cytosolicproteins Interconnecting the Endoplasmic Reticulum and Mitochondria in Parkinson's Disease and the Impact of Anti-Parkinson Drugs in the Preservation of Organelle Connectivity.
PMID: 38002511

Abstract:
Mitochondrial dysfunction is well-established in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, its dysfunctions associating with cell organelle connectivity remain unknown. We aimed to establish the crucial cytosolic protein involved in organelle connectivity between mitochondria and the endopalmic reticulum (ER) through a computational approach by constructing an organelle protein network to extract functional clusters presenting the crucial PD protein connecting organelles. Then, we assessed the influence of anti-parkinsonism drugs (<i>n</i> = 35) on the crucial protein through molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation and further validated its gene expression in PD participants under, istradefylline (<i>n</i> = 25) and amantadine (<i>n</i> = 25) treatment. Based on our investigation, D-aspartate oxidase (DDO )protein was found to be the critical that connects both mitochondria and the ER. Further, molecular docking showed that istradefylline has a high affinity (-9.073 kcal/mol) against DDO protein, which may disrupt mitochondrial-ER connectivity. While amantadine (-4.53 kcal/mol) shows negligible effects against DDO that contribute to conformational changes in drug binding, Successively, DDO gene expression was downregulated in istradefylline-treated PD participants, which elucidated the likelihood of an istradefylline off-target mechanism. Overall, our findings illuminate the off-target effects of anti-parkinsonism medications on DDO protein, enabling the recommendation of off-target-free PD treatments.
