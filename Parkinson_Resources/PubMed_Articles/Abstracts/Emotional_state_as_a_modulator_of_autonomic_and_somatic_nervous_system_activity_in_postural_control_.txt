Title: Emotional state as a modulator of autonomic and somatic nervous system activity in postural control: a review.
PMID: 37719760

Abstract:
Advances in our understanding of postural control have highlighted the need to examine the influence of higher brain centers in the modulation of this complex function. There is strong evidence of a link between emotional state, autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity and somatic nervous system (somatic NS) activity in postural control. For example, relationships have been demonstrated between postural threat, anxiety, fear of falling, balance confidence, and physiological arousal. Behaviorally, increased arousal has been associated with changes in velocity and amplitude of postural sway during quiet standing. The potential links between ANS and somatic NS, observed in control of posture, are associated with shared neuroanatomical connections within the central nervous system (CNS). The influence of emotional state on postural control likely reflects the important influence the limbic system has on these ANS/somatic NS control networks. This narrative review will highlight several examples of behaviors which routinely require coordination between the ANS and somatic NS, highlighting the importance of the neurofunctional link between these systems. Furthermore, we will extend beyond the more historical focus on threat models and examine how disordered/altered emotional state and ANS processing may influence postural control and assessment. Finally, this paper will discuss studies that have been important in uncovering the modulatory effect of emotional state on postural control including links that may inform our understanding of disordered control, such as that observed in individuals living with Parkinson's disease and discuss methodological tools that have the potential to advance understanding of this complex relationship.
