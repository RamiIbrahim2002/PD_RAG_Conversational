Title: A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor agonists, antagonists, inverse agonists and partial agonists.
PMID: 37741687

Abstract:
The Gs-coupled A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>AR) has been explored extensively as a pharmaceutical target, which has led to numerous clinical trials. However, only one selective A<sub>2A</sub>AR agonist (regadenoson, Lexiscan) and one selective A<sub>2A</sub>AR antagonist (istradefylline, Nouriast) have been approved by the FDA, as a pharmacological agent for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and as a cotherapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), respectively. Adenosine is widely used in MPI, as Adenoscan. Despite numerous unsuccessful clinical trials, medicinal chemical activity around A<sub>2A</sub>AR ligands has accelerated recently, particularly through structure-based drug design. New drug-like A<sub>2A</sub>AR antagonists for PD and cancer immunotherapy have been identified, and many clinical trials have ensued. For example, imaradenant (AZD4635), a compound that was designed computationally, based on A<sub>2A</sub>AR X-ray structures and biophysical mapping. Mixed A<sub>2A</sub>AR/A<sub>2B</sub>AR antagonists are also hopeful for cancer treatment. A<sub>2A</sub>AR antagonists may also have potential as neuroprotective agents for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
