PMID: 37631249

Abstract:
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are single-stranded RNA molecules often circularized by backsplicing. Growing evidence implicates circRNAs in the underlying mechanisms of various diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (PD)-the first and second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. In this sense, circSNCA, circHIPK2, circHIPK3, and circSLC8A1 are circRNAs that have been related to the neurodegenerative process of PD. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies on circRNAs have shed light on their roles in the pathobiology of various diseases. Gain-of-function approaches typically employ viral or non-viral vectors that hyperexpress RNA sequences capable of circularizing to form the specific circRNA under investigation. In contrast, loss-of-function studies utilize CRISPR/Cas systems, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), or RNAi techniques to knock down the target circRNA. The role of aberrantly expressed circRNAs in brain pathology has raised a critical question: could circRNAs serve as viable targets for neuroprotective treatments? Translating any oligonucleotide-based therapy, including those targeting circRNAs, involves developing adequate brain delivery systems, minimizing off-target effects, and addressing the high costs of treatment. Nonetheless, RNAi-based FDA-approved drugs have entered the market, and circRNAs have attracted significant attention and investment from major pharmaceutical companies. Spanning from bench to bedside, circRNAs present a vast opportunity in biotechnology for oligonucleotide-based therapies designed to slow or even halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.
