PMID: 38446600

Abstract:
This report describes the experience of a therapist living with Parkinson's disease who conducts two types of support groups within the Parkinson's community: a long-term patient support group and a care-partner support group. The psychosocial dynamics and therapeutic factors of the two groups are compared and contrasted, including how the therapist-member relationship differs in the two groups. Countertransference issues and how to handle these therapeutically are also described.
