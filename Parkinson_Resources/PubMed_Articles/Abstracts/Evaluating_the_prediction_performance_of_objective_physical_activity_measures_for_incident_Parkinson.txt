Title: Evaluating the prediction performance of objective physical activity measures for incident Parkinson's disease in the UK Biobank.
PMID: 37612539

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurological condition with over 10 million cases worldwide. While age and sex are known predictors of incident PD, there is a need to identify other predictors. This study compares the prediction performance of accelerometry-derived physical activity (PA) measures and traditional risk factors for incident PD in the UK Biobank.
