Title: Nigral-specific increase in ser31 phosphorylation compensates for tyrosine hydroxylase protein and nigrostriatal neuron loss: Implications for delaying parkinsonian signs.
PMID: 37634696

Abstract:
Compensatory mechanisms that augment dopamine (DA) signaling are thought to mitigate onset of hypokinesia prior to major loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in striatum that occurs in Parkinson's disease. However, the identity of such mechanisms remains elusive. In the present study, the rat nigrostriatal pathway was unilaterally-lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to determine whether differences in DA content, TH protein, TH phosphorylation, or D<sub>1</sub> receptor expression in striatum or substantia nigra (SN) aligned with hypokinesia onset and severity at two time points. In striatum, DA and TH loss reached its maximum (>90%) 7 days after lesion induction. However, in SN, no DA loss occurred, despite ∼60% TH loss. Hypokinesia was established at 21 days post-lesion and maintained at 28 days. At this time, DA loss was ∼60% in the SN, but still of lesser magnitude than TH loss. At day 7 and 28, ser31 TH phosphorylation increased only in SN, corresponding to less DA versus TH protein loss. In contrast, ser40 TH phosphorylation was unaffected in either region. Despite DA loss in both regions at day 28, D<sub>1</sub> receptor expression increased only in lesioned SN. These results support the concept that augmented components of DA signaling in the SN, through increased ser31 TH phosphorylation and D<sub>1</sub> receptor expression, contribute as compensatory mechanisms against progressive nigrostriatal neuron and TH protein loss, and may mitigate hypokinesia severity.
