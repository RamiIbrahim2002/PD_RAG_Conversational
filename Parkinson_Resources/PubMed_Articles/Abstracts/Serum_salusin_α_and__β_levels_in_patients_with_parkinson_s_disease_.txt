Title: Serum salusin-α and -β levels in patients with parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37668828

Abstract:
The etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is not well known and there is increasing evidence that oxidative stress also plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Salusins alpha (salusin-α) and beta (salusin-β) affect the central nervous system, vasculature, and kidneys to increase the inflammatory response in endothelial cells, stimulate oxidative stress, and increase monocyte-endothelial adhesion. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress play roles in the etiopathogenesis of PD.
