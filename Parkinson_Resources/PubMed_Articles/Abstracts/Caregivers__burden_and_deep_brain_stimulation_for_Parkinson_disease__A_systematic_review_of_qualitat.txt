Title: Caregivers' burden and deep brain stimulation for Parkinson disease: A systematic review of qualitative studies.
PMID: 37975788

Abstract:
The impact of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) on caregivers' burden is understudied. We perform a systematic review and meta-synthesis aggregating qualitative studies involving partners of people with Parkinson disease (PwP) to explore their experiences and unmet needs.
