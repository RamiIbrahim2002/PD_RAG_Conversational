Title: Critical roles of parkin and PINK1 in coxsackievirus B3-induced viral myocarditis.
PMID: 37574181

Abstract:
Viral myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium, often leads to cardiac dysfunction and death. PARKIN (PRKN) and PINK1, well known as Parkinson's disease-associated genes, have been reported to be involved in innate immunity and mitochondrial damage control. Therefore, we investigated the role of parkin and PINK1 in coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced viral myocarditis because the etiology of myocarditis is related to abnormal immune response to viral infection and mitochondrial damage. After viral infection, the survival was significantly lower and myocardial damage was more severe in parkin knockout (KO) and PINK1 KO mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Parkin KO and PINK1 KO showed defective immune cell recruitment and impaired production of antiviral cytokines such as interferon-gamma, allowing increased viral replication. In addition, parkin KO and PINK1 KO mice were more susceptible to CVB3-induced mitochondrial damage than WT mice, resulting in susceptibility to viral-induced cardiac damage. Finally, using publicly available RNA-seq data, we found that pathogenic mutants of the PRKN gene are more common in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and myocarditis than in controls or the general population. This study will help elucidate the molecular mechanism of CVB3-induced viral myocarditis.
