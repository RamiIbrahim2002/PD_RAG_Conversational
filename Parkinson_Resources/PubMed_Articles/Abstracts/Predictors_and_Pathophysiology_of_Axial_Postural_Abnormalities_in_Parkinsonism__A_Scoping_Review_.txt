Title: Predictors and Pathophysiology of Axial Postural Abnormalities in Parkinsonism: A Scoping Review.
PMID: 38026508

Abstract:
Postural abnormalities involving the trunk are referred to as axial postural abnormalities and can be observed in over 20% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and in atypical parkinsonism. These symptoms are highly disabling and frequently associated with back pain and a worse quality of life in PD. Despite their frequency, little is known about the pathophysiology of these symptoms and scant data are reported about their clinical predictors, making it difficult to prompt prevention strategies.
