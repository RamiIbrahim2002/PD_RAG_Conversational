Title: 6-hydroxydopamine affects multiple pathways to induce cytotoxicity in differentiated LUHMES dopaminergic neurons.
PMID: 37678429

Abstract:
The debilitating effects of Parkinson's disease (PD) progress over time and are pathophysiologically characterized by the formation of Lewy bodies due to the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates resulting in the death of dopaminergic neurons. In the present study, we determined cell death pathways activated by acute exposure to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in differentiated LUHMES cells empirically followed by a 24 h toxin free interval, henceforth termed as washout/recovery period. Acute 6-OHDA exposure led to morphological changes in LUHMES cells and resulted in significant loss of neurite length and neurite thickness. Generation of reactive oxygen species and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in the neuronal processes were persistent even after the recovery period. Our results show that 6-OHDA exposure leads to significant reduction in expression of mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes I, II, and IV and activation of caspase mediated apoptotic cell death cascade as observed by enhanced protein expression of cleaved-PARP-1 and cleaved-Caspase-3. Immunofluorescence microscopy approach confirmed that cell death occurs independent of the AIF translocation to the nucleus. Our experimental model, led to a ∼5-fold lower α-synuclein monomer expression and, interestingly, resulted in loss of protein ubiquitination in whole cell lysates. Altogether, this work provides evidence of multiple pathways targeted by 6-OHDA in differentiated LUHMES cells and expands research avenues for addressing the knowledge gap regarding the effect of 6-OHDA in the ubiquitin proteasome system for PD therapies.
