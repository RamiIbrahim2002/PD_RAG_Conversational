PMID: 37633737

Abstract:
Among the workshops of our therapeutic patient education (TPE) program, the medication workshop (TPEM workshop) is very frequently proposed to patients in view of the difficulties they encounter related to the complexity of managing antiparkinsonian treatment. Patients' appropriation of their medications could depend on their social representations.
