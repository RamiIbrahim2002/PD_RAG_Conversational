Title: Nacre-Inspired MXene Nanocomposite-based Strain Sensor with Ultrahigh Sensitivity in a Small Strain Range for Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis.
PMID: 37857376

Abstract:
Nowadays, chronic diseases are the primary threat to public health and are getting younger. By taking the advantages of continuousness, convenience, and real-time response, wearable strain sensors have been given great attention to diagnose chronic diseases via analyzing the patient's health state. However, most physiological signals, such as limb tremor of Parkinson's disease, microexpression, and slight joint movement, are tiny and difficult to be detected. Therefore, the development of strain sensors characterized with ultrahigh sensitivity in a small strain range (ε < 10%) is urgent. Inspired by nacre's hierarchical structure, we have fabricated nacre-mimetic nanocomposites with "brick-and-mortar" architecture by employing polyacrylamide (PAM) and Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub> MXene nanosheets through a layer-by-layer (LBL) spin-coating technique. The resultant nanocomposite-based strain sensor exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity in a small strain range (GF = 296.8, ε < 10%), attributed to the bioinspired hierarchical structure and hydrogen bond-enhanced interfacial interactions. In addition, a high reliability, broad working sensing range (453%), short response time (183 ms), skin-like tensile stress (7.2 MPa), and excellent durability (2000 cycles) are also achieved. Due to the ultrahigh sensitivity within a small strain, the reported strain sensor can accurately diagnose and distinguish Parkinson's disease symptoms, including thumb pill-rolling tremor, masked face (microexpression), intermittent shaking of the head, and limb cogwheel motion. This work provides new insights to design strain sensors with high sensitivity for monitoring tiny signals and for disease diagnosis.
