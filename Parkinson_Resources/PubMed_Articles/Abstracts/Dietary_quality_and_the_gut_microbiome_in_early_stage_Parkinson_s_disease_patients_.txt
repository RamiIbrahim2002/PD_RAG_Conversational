Title: Dietary quality and the gut microbiome in early-stage Parkinson's disease patients.
PMID: 37711026

Abstract:
The prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) has increased steadily with the increase of the elderly population. PD may influence dietary intake and quality, and the gut microbiome composition. The present study examined differences in dietary intake and quality between PD patients and controls according to sex. In addition, we assessed the gut microbiome composition.
