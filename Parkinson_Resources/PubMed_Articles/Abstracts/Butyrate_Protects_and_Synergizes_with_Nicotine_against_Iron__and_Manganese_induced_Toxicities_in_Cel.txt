Title: Butyrate Protects and Synergizes with Nicotine against Iron- and Manganese-induced Toxicities in Cell Culture.
PMID: 38095760

Abstract:
Toxic exposures to heavy metals, such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn), can result in long-range neurological diseases and are therefore of significant environmental and medical concerns. We have previously reported that damage to neuroblastoma-derived dopaminergic cells (SH-SY5Y) by both Fe and Mn could be prevented by pre-treatment with nicotine. Moreover, butyrate, a short chain fatty acid (SCFA) provided protection against salsolinol, a selective dopaminergic toxin, in the same cell line. Here, we broadened the investigation to determine whether butyrate might also protect against Fe and/or Mn, and whether, if combined with nicotine, an additive or synergistic effect might be observed. Both butyrate and nicotine concentration-dependently blocked Fe and Mn toxicities. Ineffective concentrations of nicotine and butyrate, when combined, provided full protection against both Fe and Mn. Moreover, the effects of nicotine but not butyrate could be blocked by mecamylamine, a non-selective nicotinic antagonist. On the other hand, the effects of butyrate, but not nicotine, could be blocked by beta-hydroxy butyrate, a fatty acid-3 receptor antagonist. These results not only provide further support for neuroprotective effects of both nicotine and butyrate but also indicate distinct mechanisms of action for each one. Furthermore, potential utility of butyrate and nicotine combination against heavy metal toxicities is suggested.
