Title: Role of Nitric Oxide Modulators in Neuroprotective Effects of Mangiferin in 6-Hydroxydopamine-induced Parkinson's Disease in Rats.
PMID: 39156628

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is typified by inflammation of dopaminergic neurons leading to the release of various inflammatory mediators. These mediators activate the transcription factor NF-ÎºB, which in turn activates inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), leading to increased inflammation.
