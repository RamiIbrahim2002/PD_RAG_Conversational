PMID: 37500992

Abstract:
Diabetes mellitus is a known risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), but does this risk vary with antidiabetic medications is still unclear. This meta-analysis aims to compile evidence from the literature to assess the risk of idiopathic PD with various oral antidiabetic medications.
