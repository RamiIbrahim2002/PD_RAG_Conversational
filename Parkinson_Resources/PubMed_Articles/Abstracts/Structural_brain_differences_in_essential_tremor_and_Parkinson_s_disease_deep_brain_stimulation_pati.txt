Title: Structural brain differences in essential tremor and Parkinson's disease deep brain stimulation patients.
PMID: 37549435

Abstract:
Essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common tremor disorders and are common indications for deep brain stimulation (DBS). In some patients, PD and ET symptoms overlap and diagnosis can be challenging based on clinical criteria alone. The objective of this study was to identify structural brain differences between PD and ET DBS patients to help differentiate these disorders and improve our understanding of the different brain regions involved in these pathologic processes.
