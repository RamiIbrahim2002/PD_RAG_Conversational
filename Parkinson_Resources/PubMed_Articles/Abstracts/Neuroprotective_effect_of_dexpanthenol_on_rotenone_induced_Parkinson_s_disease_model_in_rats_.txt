Title: Neuroprotective effect of dexpanthenol on rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease model in rats.
PMID: 38040406

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common and progressive neurodegenerative disease. This experimental study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of dexpanthenol on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory processes in a rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease model in rats. Twenty-one male rats were randomly divided into 2 groups. The rotenone group (n = 14) was administered rotenone by intrastriatal injection, and the vehicle group (n = 7) was administered DMSO with the same application route. All animals underwent rotational movement testing with apomorphine injection 10 days later. Those with Parkinson's disease model were randomly divided into 2 groups. While 1 ml/kg of saline was applied to the saline group (n = 7), 500 mg/kg was administered to the dexpanthenol group intraperitoneally for 28 days. After 28 days, all rats were euthanized and brain tissue was removed. While striatal areas were evaluated immunohistochemically, brain MDA, TNF-α, and HVA levels were measured to evaluate their anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. In the dexpanthenol group, the total count (p < 0.001) and intensity (p < 0.001) of dopaminergic neurons in the striatal areas increased compared to the saline group. It was revealed that MDA (nmol/g) (p < 0.001) and TNF-α (pg/g) (p < 0.001) levels decreased in the dexpanthenol group, while HVA (ng/mg) levels increased (p < 0.01). This study suggests that dexpanthenol may have a neuroprotective effect by reducing neuronal loss, oxidative damage, and neuroinflammation in the striatum in rats.
