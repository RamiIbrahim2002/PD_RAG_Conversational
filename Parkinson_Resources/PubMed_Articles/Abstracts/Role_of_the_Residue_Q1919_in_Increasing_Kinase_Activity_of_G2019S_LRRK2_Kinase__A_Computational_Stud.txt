Title: Role of the Residue Q1919 in Increasing Kinase Activity of G2019S LRRK2 Kinase: A Computational Study.
PMID: 37584472

Abstract:
Mutations in multi-domain leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have been an interest to researchers as these mutations are associated with Parkinson's disease. G2019S mutation in LRRK2 kinase domain leads to the formation of additional hydrogen bonds by S2019 which results in stabilization of the active state of the kinase, thereby increasing kinase activity. Two additional hydrogen bonds of S2019 are reported separately. Here, a mechanistic picture of the formation of additional hydrogen bonds of S2019 with Q1919 (also with E1920) is presented using 'active' Roco4 kinase as a homology model and its relationship with the stabilization of the 'active' G2019S LRRK2 kinase. A conformational flipping of residue Q1919 was found which helped to form stable hydrogen bond with S2019 and made 'active' state more stable in G2019S LRRK2. Two different states were found within the 'active' kinase with respect to the conformational change (flipping) in Q1919. Two doubly-mutated systems, G2019S/Q1919A and G2019S/E1920â€…K, were studied separately to check the effect of Q1919 and E1920. For both cases, the stable S2 state was not formed, leading to a decrease in kinase activity. These results indicate that both the additional hydrogen bonds of S2019 (with Q1919 and E1920) are necessary to stabilize the active G2019S LRRK2.
