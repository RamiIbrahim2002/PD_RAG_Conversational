Title: Role of Specific Autoantibodies in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Pathogenic Antibodies or Promising Biomarkers for Diagnosis.
PMID: 38131803

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) affect millions of people worldwide. They develop due to the pathological accumulation and aggregation of various misfolded proteins, axonal and synaptic loss and dysfunction, inflammation, cytoskeletal abnormalities, defects in DNA and RNA, and neuronal death. This leads to the activation of immune responses and the release of the antibodies against them. Recently, it has become clear that autoantibodies (Aabs) can contribute to demyelination, axonal loss, and brain and cognitive dysfunction. This has significantly changed the understanding of the participation of humoral autoimmunity in neurodegenerative disorders. It is crucial to understand how neuroinflammation is involved in neurodegeneration, to aid in improving the diagnostic and therapeutic value of Aabs in the future. This review aims to provide data on the immune system's role in NDDs, the pathogenic role of some specific Aabs against molecules associated with the most common NDDs, and their potential role as biomarkers for monitoring and diagnosing NDDs. It is suggested that the autoimmune aspects of NDDs will facilitate early diagnosis and help to elucidate previously unknown aspects of the pathobiology of these diseases.
