PMID: 37896105

Abstract:
<i>Polyscias fruticosa</i> (L.) Harms, or Ming aralia, is a medicinal plant of the Araliaceae family, which is highly valued for its antitoxic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antibacterial, anti-asthmatic, adaptogenic, and other properties. The plant can be potentially used to treat diabetes and its complications, ischemic brain damage, and Parkinson's disease. Triterpene glycosides of the oleanane type, such as 3-<i>O</i>-[β-<i>D</i>-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-<i>D</i>-glucuronopyranosyl] oleanolic acid 28-<i>O</i>-β-<i>D</i>-glucopyranosyl ester (PFS), ladyginoside A, and polysciosides A-H, are mainly responsible for biological activities of this species. In this study, cultivation of the cell suspension of <i>P. fruticosa</i> in 20 L bubble-type bioreactors was attempted as a sustainable method for cell biomass production of this valuable species and an alternative to overexploitation of wild plant resources. Cell suspension cultivated in bioreactors under a semi-continuous regime demonstrated satisfactory growth with a specific growth rate of 0.11 day<sup>-1</sup>, productivity of 0.32 g (L · day)<sup>-1,</sup> and an economic coefficient of 0.16 but slightly lower maximum biomass accumulation (~6.8 g L<sup>-1</sup>) compared to flask culture (~8.2 g L<sup>-1</sup>). Triterpene glycosides PFS (0.91 mg gDW<sup>-1</sup>) and ladyginoside A (0.77 mg gDW<sup>-1</sup>) were detected in bioreactor-produced cell biomass in higher concentrations compared to cells grown in flasks (0.50 and 0.22 mg gDW<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). In antibacterial tests, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cell biomass extracts against the most common pathogens <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, methicillin-resistant strain MRSA, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i> varied within 250-2000 µg mL<sup>-1</sup> which was higher compared to extracts of greenhouse plant leaves (MIC = 4000 µg mL<sup>-1</sup>). Cell biomass extracts also exhibited antioxidant activity, as confirmed by DPPH and TEAC assays. Our results suggest that bioreactor cultivation of <i>P. fruticosa</i> suspension cell culture may be a perspective method for the sustainable biomass production of this species.
