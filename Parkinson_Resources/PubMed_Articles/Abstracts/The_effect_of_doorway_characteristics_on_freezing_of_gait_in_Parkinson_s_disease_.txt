Title: The effect of doorway characteristics on freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38111795

Abstract:
Freezing of gait is a debilitating symptom in Parkinson's disease, during which a sudden motor block prevents someone from moving forward. Remarkably, doorways can provoke freezing. Most research has focused on the influence of doorway width, and little is known about other doorway characteristics influencing doorway freezing.
