Title: Prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies in REM sleep behavior disorder: A multicenter study.
PMID: 37461299

Abstract:
Isolated/idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a powerful early predictor of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD). This provides an opportunity to directly observe the evolution of prodromal DLB and to identify which cognitive variables are the strongest predictors of evolving dementia.
