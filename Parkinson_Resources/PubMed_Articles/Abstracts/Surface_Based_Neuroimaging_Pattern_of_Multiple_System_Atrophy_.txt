Title: Surface-Based Neuroimaging Pattern of Multiple System Atrophy.
PMID: 37495425

Abstract:
Overlapping parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and pyramidal signs render challenges in the clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy (MSA). The neuroimaging pattern is valuable to understand its pathophysiology and improve its diagnostic effect.
