Title: Do Bone Mineral Density, Trabecular Bone Score, and Hip Structural Analysis Differ in Indian Men with Parkinson's Disease? A Case-Control Pilot Study from a Tertiary Center in Southern India.
PMID: 37970318

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that is characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, and gait instability. Inherent to this condition is an increased predisposition to falls and fractures. Bone health in Parkinson's disease in India has not been studied thus far. This study aimed to assess the bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular bone score (TBS), and hip structural analysis (HSA) in Indian men with PD and compare them with matched controls.
