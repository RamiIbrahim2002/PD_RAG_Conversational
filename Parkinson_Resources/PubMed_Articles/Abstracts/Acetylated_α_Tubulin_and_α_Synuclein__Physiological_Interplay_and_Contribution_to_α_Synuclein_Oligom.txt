Title: Acetylated α-Tubulin and α-Synuclein: Physiological Interplay and Contribution to α-Synuclein Oligomerization.
PMID: 37569662

Abstract:
Emerging evidence supports that altered α-tubulin acetylation occurs in Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of α-synuclein fibrillary aggregates within Lewy bodies and nigrostriatal neuron degeneration. Nevertheless, studies addressing the interplay between α-tubulin acetylation and α-synuclein are lacking. Here, we investigated the relationship between α-synuclein and microtubules in primary midbrain murine neurons and the substantia nigra of post-mortem human brains. Taking advantage of immunofluorescence and Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA), a method allowing us to visualize protein-protein interactions in situ, combined with confocal and super-resolution microscopy, we found that α-synuclein and acetylated α-tubulin colocalized and were in close proximity. Next, we employed an α-synuclein overexpressing cellular model and tested the role of α-tubulin acetylation in α-synuclein oligomer formation. We used the α-tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 inhibitor Tubacin to modulate α-tubulin acetylation, and we evaluated the presence of α-synuclein oligomers by PLA. We found that the increase in acetylated α-tubulin significantly induced α-synuclein oligomerization. In conclusion, we unraveled the link between acetylated α-tubulin and α-synuclein and demonstrated that α-tubulin acetylation could trigger the early step of α-synuclein aggregation. These data suggest that the proper regulation of α-tubulin acetylation might be considered a therapeutic strategy to take on PD.
