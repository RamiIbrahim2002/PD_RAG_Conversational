Title: Deep-Brain Subthalamic Nucleus Stimulation Enhances Food-Related Motivation by Influencing Neuroinflammation and Anxiety Levels in a Rat Model of Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 38069238

Abstract:
Deep-brain subthalamic nucleus stimulation (DBS-STN) has become a well-established therapeutic option for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). While the motor benefits of DBS-STN are widely acknowledged, the neuropsychiatric effects are still being investigated. Beyond its immediate effects on neuronal circuits, emerging research suggests that DBS-STN might also modulate the peripheral inflammation and neuroinflammation. In this work, we assessed the effects of DBS-STN on food-related motivation, food intake pattern, and the level of anxiety and compared them with markers of cellular and immune activation in nigrostriatal and mesolimbic areas in rats with the 6-OHDA model of early PD. To evaluate the potential mechanism of observed effects, we also measured corticosterone concentration in plasma and leukocyte distribution in peripheral blood. We found that DBS-STN applied during neurodegeneration has beneficial effects on food intake pattern and motivation and reduces anxiety. These behavioral effects occur with reduced percentages of IL-6-labeled cells in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta in the stimulated brain hemisphere. At the same brain structures, the cFos cell activations were confirmed. Simultaneously, the corticosterone plasma concentration was elevated, and the peripheral blood lymphocytes were reduced after DBS-STN. We believe that comprehending the relationship between the effects of DBS-STN on inflammation and its therapeutic results is essential for optimizing DBS therapy in PD.
