Title: NPC1-like phenotype, with intracellular cholesterol accumulation and altered mTORC1 signaling in models of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 38061599

Abstract:
Disruption of brain cholesterol homeostasis has been implicated in neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, the role of cholesterol in Parkinson's Disease (PD) remains unclear. We have used N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells and primary cultures of mouse neurons and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>), a known mitochondrial complex I inhibitor and the toxic metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), known to trigger a cascade of events associated with PD neuropathological features. Simultaneously, we utilized other mitochondrial toxins, including antimycin A, oligomycin, and carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone. MPP<sup>+</sup> treatment resulted in elevated levels of total cholesterol and in a Niemann Pick type C1 (NPC1)-like phenotype characterized by accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes. Interestingly, NPC1 mRNA levels were specifically reduced by MPP<sup>+</sup>. The decrease in NPC1 levels was also seen in midbrain and striatum from MPTP-treated mice and in primary cultures of neurons treated with MPP<sup>+</sup>. Together with the MPP<sup>+</sup>-dependent increase in intracellular cholesterol levels in N2a cells, we observed an increase in 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and a concomitant increase in the phosphorylated levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). NPC1 knockout delayed cell death induced by acute mitochondrial damage, suggesting that transient cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes could be a protective mechanism against MPTP/MPP<sup>+</sup> insult. Interestingly, we observed a negative correlation between NPC1 protein levels and disease stage, in human PD brain samples. In summary, MPP<sup>+</sup> decreases NPC1 levels, elevates lysosomal cholesterol accumulation and alters mTOR signaling, adding to the existing notion that PD may rise from alterations in mitochondrial-lysosomal communication.
