Title: A primate nigrostriatal atlas of neuronal vulnerability and resilience in a model of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37980356

Abstract:
The degenerative process in Parkinson's disease (PD) causes a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons (DaNs) in the nigrostriatal system. Resolving the differences in neuronal susceptibility warrants an amenable PD model that, in comparison to post-mortem human specimens, controls for environmental and genetic differences in PD pathogenesis. Here we generated high-quality profiles for 250,173 cells from the substantia nigra (SN) and putamen (PT) of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonian macaques and matched controls. Our primate model of parkinsonism recapitulates important pathologic features in nature PD and provides an unbiased view of the axis of neuronal vulnerability and resistance. We identified seven molecularly defined subtypes of nigral DaNs which manifested a gradient of vulnerability and were confirmed by fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting. Neuronal resilience was associated with a FOXP2-centered regulatory pathway shared between PD-resistant DaNs and glutamatergic excitatory neurons, as well as between humans and nonhuman primates. We also discovered activation of immune response common to glial cells of SN and PT, indicating concurrently activated pathways in the nigrostriatal system. Our study provides a unique resource to understand the mechanistic connections between neuronal susceptibility and PD pathophysiology, and to facilitate future biomarker discovery and targeted cell therapy.
