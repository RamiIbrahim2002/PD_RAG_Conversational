Title: A video-atlas of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease: terminology matters.
PMID: 37987930

Abstract:
Dyskinesia is a common complication of long-term levodopa therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), which often worsens the quality of life. It is usually dose-dependent and emerges possibly due to pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors. Delineating the pattern of dyskinesia is crucial for determining the most effective therapeutic approach, a task that often presents challenges for numerous neurologists. This article comprehensively describes various patterns of dyskinesia in PD patients and features video demonstration of some of the common forms of dyskinesia. We have used a real case scenario as an example to lead the discussion on the phenomenology, distinguishing features, and management of various types of dyskinesia. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed using "dyskinesia" as a keyword. The prototype case with videos highlights the differentiating features of dyskinesia along with the treatment strategies. A wide range of descriptive rubrics have been used for certain dyskinesia which are described in detail in this article. The newer types of dyskinesia associated with continuous dopaminergic stimulation in patients with advanced PD and their implications have been described. As there are distinct ways of managing various types of dyskinesia, understanding the phenomenology and chronology of dyskinesia is vital for the optimal management of dyskinetic PD patients. We suggest that dyskinesia should be classified broadly into peak-dose dyskinesia (PDD), biphasic dyskinesia (BD), and OFF-period dystonia. The occurrence of low-dose dyskinesia and complex dyskinesia of continuous dopaminergic treatments should be known to specialists and will require additional studies.
