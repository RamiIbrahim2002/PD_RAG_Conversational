Title: Dyrk1a Phosphorylation of <i>α</i>-Synuclein Mediating Apoptosis of Dopaminergic Neurons in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 37469393

Abstract:
To investigate the role of aberrant Dyrk1a expression in phosphorylation modification at the <i>α</i>-synuclein serine 129 (Ser129) site to analyze its molecular mechanism in mediating apoptosis of PD.
