Title: Defects in Mitochondrial Biogenesis Drive Mitochondrial Alterations in PINK1-deficient Human Dopamine Neurons.
PMID: 37425943

Abstract:
Mutations and loss of activity in the protein kinase PINK1 play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). PINK1 regulates many aspects of mitochondrial quality control including mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), fission, fusion, transport, and biogenesis. Defects in mitophagy are though to play a predominant role in the loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in PD. Here we show that, although there are defects in mitophagy in human DA neurons lacking PINK1, mitochondrial deficits induced by the absence of PINK1 are primarily due to defects in mitochondrial biogenesis. Upregulation of PARIS and the subsequent down regulation of PGC-1a accounts for the mitochondrial biogenesis defects. CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown of PARIS completely restores the mitochondrial biogenesis defects and mitochondrial function without impacting the deficits in mitophagy due to the absence of PINK1. These results highlight the importance mitochondrial biogenesis in the pathogenesis of PD due to inactivation or loss of PINK1 in human DA neurons.
