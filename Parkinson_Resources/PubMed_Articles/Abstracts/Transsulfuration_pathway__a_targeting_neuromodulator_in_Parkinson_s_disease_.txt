Title: Transsulfuration pathway: a targeting neuromodulator in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37409540

Abstract:
The transsulfuration pathway (TSP) is a metabolic pathway involving sulfur transfer from homocysteine to cysteine. Transsulfuration pathway leads to many sulfur metabolites, principally glutathione, H<sub>2</sub>S, taurine, and cysteine. Key enzymes of the TSP, such as cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase, are essential regulators at multiple levels in this pathway. TSP metabolites are implicated in many physiological processes in the central nervous system and other tissues. TSP is important in controlling sulfur balance and optimal cellular functions such as glutathione synthesis. Alterations in the TSP and related pathways (transmethylation and remethylation) are altered in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, suggesting their participation in the pathophysiology and progression of these diseases. In Parkinson's disease many cellular processes are comprised mainly those that regulate redox homeostasis, inflammation, reticulum endoplasmic stress, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and sulfur content metabolites of TSP are involved in these damage processes. Current research on the transsulfuration pathway in Parkinson's disease has primarily focused on the synthesis and function of certain metabolites, particularly glutathione. However, our understanding of the regulation of other metabolites of the transsulfuration pathway, as well as their relationships with other metabolites, and their synthesis regulation in Parkinson´s disease remain limited. Thus, this paper highlights the importance of studying the molecular dynamics in different metabolites and enzymes that affect the transsulfuration in Parkinson's disease.
