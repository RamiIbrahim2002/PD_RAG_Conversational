Title: Unraveling the transcriptomic signatures of Parkinson's disease and major depression using single-cell and bulk data.
PMID: 38020762

Abstract:
Motor symptoms are well-characterized in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, non-motor symptoms, such as depression, are commonly observed and can appear up to 10 years before motor features, resulting in one-third of individuals being misdiagnosed with a neuropsychiatric disorder. Thus, identifying diagnostic biomarkers is crucial for accurate PD diagnosis during its prodromal or early stages.
