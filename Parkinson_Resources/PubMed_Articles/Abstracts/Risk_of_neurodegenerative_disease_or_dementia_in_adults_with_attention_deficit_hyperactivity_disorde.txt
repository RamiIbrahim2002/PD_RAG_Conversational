PMID: 37663597

Abstract:
Several psychiatric disorders have been associated with an increased risk of developing a neurodegenerative disease and/or dementia. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurodevelopmental disorder, has been understudied in relation to dementia risk. We summarized existing literature investigating the risk of incident neurodegenerative disease or dementia associated with ADHD.
