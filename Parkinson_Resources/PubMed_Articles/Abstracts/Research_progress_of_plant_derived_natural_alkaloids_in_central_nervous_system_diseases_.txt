PMID: 37455555

Abstract:
Central nervous system (CNS) disease is one of the most important causes of human death. Because of their complex pathogenesis, more and more attention has been paid to them. At present, drug treatment of the CNS is the main means; however, most drugs only relieve symptoms, and some have certain toxicity and side effects. Natural compounds derived from plants can provide safer and more effective alternatives. Alkaloids are common nitrogenous basic organic compounds found in nature, which exist widely in many kinds of plants and have unique application value in modern medicine. For example, Galantamine and Huperzine A from medicinal plants are widely used drugs on the market to treat Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the main purpose of this review is to provide the available information on natural alkaloids with the activity of treating central nervous system diseases in order to explore the trends and perspectives for the further study of central nervous system drugs. In this paper, 120 alkaloids with the potential effect of treating central nervous system diseases are summarized from the aspects of sources, structure types, mechanism of action and structure-activity relationship.
