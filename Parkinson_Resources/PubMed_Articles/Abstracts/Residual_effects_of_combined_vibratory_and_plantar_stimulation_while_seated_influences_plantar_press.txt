Title: Residual effects of combined vibratory and plantar stimulation while seated influences plantar pressure and spatiotemporal gait measures in individuals with Parkinson's disease exhibiting freezing of gait.
PMID: 38264550

Abstract:
Combined plantar pressure and vibratory stimulation has been shown to decrease freezing of gait (FOG) episodes and improve spatiotemporal gait parameters compared to single stimulation in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with FOG. However, the effect of combined plantar stimulations on plantar pressure analysis has never been explored.
