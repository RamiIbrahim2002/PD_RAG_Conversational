Title: Chronic constipation in Parkinson's disease: clinical features and molecular insights on the intestinal epithelial barrier.
PMID: 38223240

Abstract:
Chronic constipation (CC) is a severe symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), with an unclear pathogenesis. Abnormalities of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and/or intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) may be pathophysiologically relevant in PD patients with CC. We investigated possible molecular changes of the IEB in PD/CCs compared with CCs and controls.
