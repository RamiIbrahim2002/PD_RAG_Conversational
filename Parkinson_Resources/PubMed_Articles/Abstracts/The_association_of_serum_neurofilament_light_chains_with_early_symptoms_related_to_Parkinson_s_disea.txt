Title: The association of serum neurofilament light chains with early symptoms related to Parkinson's disease: A cross-sectional study.
PMID: 37805158

Abstract:
Neurofilament light chains (NfL), released with neural axon injury, is considered as a potential biomarker for Parkinson's disease (PD). The relationship between NfL and PD has been studied mainly in diagnosed patients. Few large-scale studies analyze the association between NfL levels and multiple non-motor symptoms linked to early PD in the general population. Therefore, this study aims to determine the association of NfL with early symptoms of PD, and effectively respond to the development of early symptoms of PD. We examined the relationship between serum NfL and early non-motor symptoms of PD (smell dysfunction, sleep problems, cognitive function) and serum Klotho levels in the general population using data from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The relationship between serum NfL and early symptoms of PD in 1125 participants was analyzed by multiple linear regression and logistic regression models. The results showed a significant association between serum NfL and early symptoms of PD. There was a significant positive correlation between NfL and smell dysfunction, short sleep and long sleep. There was a significant negative correlation between NfL and Klotho levels and cognitive function test results. Further, we observed gender and age differences in the association of NfL with early symptoms of PD. Our study demonstrate that elevated serum NfL levels are positively associated with an increased risk of early PD-related symptoms, suggesting that serum NfL can be a promising biomarker for early PD.
