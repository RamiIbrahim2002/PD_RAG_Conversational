Title: Velusetrag rescues GI dysfunction, gut inflammation and dysbiosis in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37783672

Abstract:
In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), constipation is common, and it appears in a prodromal stage before the hallmark motor symptoms. The present study aimed to investigate whether Velusetrag, a selective 5‑HT4 receptor agonist, may be a suitable candidate to improve intestinal motility in a mouse model of PD. Five months old PrP human A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic (Tg) mice, which display severe constipation along with decreased colonic cholinergic transmission already at 3 months, were treated daily with the drug for 4 weeks. Velusetrag treatment reduced constipation by significantly stimulating both the longitudinal and circular-driven contractions and improved inflammation by reducing the level of serum and colonic IL1β and TNF-α and by decreasing the number of GFAP-positive glia cells in the colon of treated mice. No significant downregulation of the 5-HT4 receptor was observed but instead Velusetrag seemed to improve axonal degeneration in Tgs as shown by an increase in NF-H and VAChT staining. Ultimately, Velusetrag restored a well-balanced intestinal microbial composition comparable to non-Tg mice. Based on these promising data, we are confident that Velusetrag is potentially eligible for clinical studies to treat constipation in PD patients.
