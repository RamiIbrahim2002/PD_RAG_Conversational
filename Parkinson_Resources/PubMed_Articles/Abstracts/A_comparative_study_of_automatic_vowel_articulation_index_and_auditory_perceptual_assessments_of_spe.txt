Title: A comparative study of automatic vowel articulation index and auditory-perceptual assessments of speech intelligibility in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37800979

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to analyse the relationship between automatic vowel articulation index (aVAI) and direct magnitude estimation (DME) among speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy controls. We further analysed the potential of aVAI to serve as an objective measure of speech impairment in the clinical setting.
