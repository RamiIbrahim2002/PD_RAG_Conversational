Title: Educational level and its association with dopamine transporter loss in patients with Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37690218

Abstract:
According to the cognitive-reserve concept, higher educated dementia patients tolerate more brain pathology than lower educated patients with similar impairment. Here, we examined whether higher education is associated with more severe dopamine terminal loss at the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD).
