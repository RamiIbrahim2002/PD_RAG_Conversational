PMID: 38056105

Abstract:
Motor and non-motor symptoms affect functional autonomy, mobility and daily life activities in People with Parkinson's Disease (PwPD). Brazilian Dance (BD), Deep-water exercise (DWE), and Nordic Walking (NW) are well-accepted, low-cost, and safe non-pharmacological strategies for untrained PwPD. However, no previous studies have investigated and compared the effects of these interventions on trained PwPD.
