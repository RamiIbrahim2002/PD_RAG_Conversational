Abstract:
According to recent findings, Phosphoglycerate Kinase 1 (pgk-1) enzyme is linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). Mutations in the PGK-1 gene lead to decreases in the pgk-1 enzyme which causes an imbalance in the levels of energy demand and supply. An increase in glycolytic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production would help alleviate energy deficiency and sustain the acute energetic need of neurons. Neurodegeneration is caused by an imbalance or reduction in ATP levels. Recent data suggest that medications that increase glycolysis and neuroprotection can be used to treat PD. The current study focuses on treatment options for disorders associated with the pgk-1 enzyme, GLP-1, and A<sub>2A</sub> receptor which can be utilized to treat PD. A combination of metformin and terazosin, exenatide and meclizine, istradefylline and salbutamol treatments may benefit parkinsonism. The review also looked at potential target-specific new techniques that might assist in satisfying unfulfilled requirements in the treatment of PD.
