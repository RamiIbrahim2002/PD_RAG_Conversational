Title: Glycated hemoglobin A1c, cerebral small vessel disease burden, and disease severity in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37750198

Abstract:
Our study aimed to investigate the glucose levels in PD and controls. We also examine whether glucose control is associated with PD severity regardless of diabetic status, and test whether the correlation is mediated by cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) burden.
