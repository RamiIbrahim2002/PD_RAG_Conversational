Title: Patient-specific models link neurotransmitter receptor mechanisms with motor and visuospatial axes of Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37752107

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease involves multiple neurotransmitter systems beyond the classical dopaminergic circuit, but their influence on structural and functional alterations is not well understood. Here, we use patient-specific causal brain modeling to identify latent neurotransmitter receptor-mediated mechanisms contributing to Parkinson's disease progression. Combining the spatial distribution of 15 receptors from post-mortem autoradiography with 6 neuroimaging-derived pathological factors, we detect a diverse set of receptors influencing gray matter atrophy, functional activity dysregulation, microstructural degeneration, and dendrite and dopaminergic transporter loss. Inter-individual variability in receptor mechanisms correlates with symptom severity along two distinct axes, representing motor and psychomotor symptoms with large GABAergic and glutamatergic contributions, and cholinergically-dominant visuospatial, psychiatric and memory dysfunction. Our work demonstrates that receptor architecture helps explain multi-factorial brain re-organization, and suggests that distinct, co-existing receptor-mediated processes underlie Parkinson's disease.
