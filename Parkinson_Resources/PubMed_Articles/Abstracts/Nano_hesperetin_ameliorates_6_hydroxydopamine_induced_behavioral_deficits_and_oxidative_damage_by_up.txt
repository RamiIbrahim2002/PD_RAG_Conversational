Title: Nano-hesperetin ameliorates 6-hydroxydopamine-induced behavioral deficits and oxidative damage by up-regulating gene expression of antioxidant enzymes.
PMID: 37655004

Abstract:
Hesperetin (Hst) has shown several pharmacological effects. The efficacy of Hst is highly restricted <i>in vivo</i> due mainly to poor bioavailability. This investigation was intended to compare the influence of Hst and nano-Hst treatment on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced behavioral deficits and oxidative stress in rats.
