Title: Feasibility and Proof-of-Concept of Delivering an Autonomous Music-Based Digital Walking Intervention to Persons with Parkinson's Disease in a Naturalistic Setting.
PMID: 37840504

Abstract:
Reduced motor automaticity in Parkinson's disease (PD) negatively impacts the quality, intensity, and amount of daily walking. Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS), a clinical intervention shown to improve walking outcomes, has been limited by barriers associated with the need for ongoing clinician input.
