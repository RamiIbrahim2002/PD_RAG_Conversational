Title: Behind the Mask of Parkinsonism: A Case Report and Literature Review on Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.
PMID: 38022214

Abstract:
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative condition that typically emerges in adulthood and does not exhibit any familial inheritance pattern. PSP is characterized by gradual stiffness in the central body, an inability to move the gaze upward voluntarily, postural instability, and a decline in cognitive function linked to frontal lobe dysfunction. Clinical assessment reveals a variety of findings, and cases of PSP frequently go unnoticed or are incorrectly diagnosed as other conditions. Notably, prominent neurotransmitter-related changes in PSP involve damage to the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway and cholinergic impairment in multiple regions. We hereby present a case of a 71-year-old female patient whose medical journey unfolds as a perplexing riddle. Despite the collective expertise of several physicians, she found herself bearing the weight of a misdiagnosis ascribed to Parkinson's Disease (PD) erroneously.Â She initially presented with recurring falls due to postural instability and bradykinesia, which progressed such that she became dependent on a walking aid. A comprehensive physical examination revealed indicators consistent with PSP.
