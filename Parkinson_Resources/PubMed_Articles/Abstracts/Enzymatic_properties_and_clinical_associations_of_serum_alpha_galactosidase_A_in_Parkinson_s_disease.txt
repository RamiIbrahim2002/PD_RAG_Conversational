Title: Enzymatic properties and clinical associations of serum alpha-galactosidase A in Parkinson's disease.
PMID: 37496179

Abstract:
Recent studies have revealed an association between Parkinson's disease (PD) and Fabry disease, a lysosomal storage disorder; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the enzymatic properties of serum alpha-galactosidase A (GLA) and compared them with the clinical parameters of PD.
