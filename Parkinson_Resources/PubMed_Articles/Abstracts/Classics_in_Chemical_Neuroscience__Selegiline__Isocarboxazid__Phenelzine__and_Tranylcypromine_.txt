Abstract:
The discovery of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) in the 1950s marked a significant breakthrough in medicine, creating a powerful new category of drug: the antidepressant. In the years and decades that followed, MAOIs have been used in the treatment of several pathologies including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and various cancers and as anti-inflammatory agents. Despite once enjoying widespread use, MAOIs have dwindled in popularity due to side effects, food-drug interactions, and the introduction of other antidepressant drug classes such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The recently published prescriber's guide for the use of MAOIs in treating depression has kindled a resurgence of their use in the clinical space. It is therefore timely to review key aspects of the four "classic" MAOIs: high-dose selegiline, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, and tranylcypromine. This review discusses their chemical synthesis, metabolism, pharmacology, adverse effects, and the history and importance of these drugs within the broader field of chemical neuroscience.
