Title: The roles of FLOT1 in human diseases (Review).
PMID: 37772385

Abstract:
FLOT1, a scaffold protein of lipid rafts, is involved in several biological processes, including lipid raft protein‑-dependent or clathrin‑independent endocytosis, and the formation of hippocampal synapses, amongst others. Increasing evidence has shown that FLOT1 can function as both a cancer promoter and cancer suppressor dependent on the type of cancer. FLOT1 can affect the occurrence and development of several types of cancer by affecting epithelial‑mesenchymal transition, proliferation of cancer cells, and relevant signaling pathways, and is regulated by long intergenic non‑coding RNAs or microRNAs. In the nervous system, overexpression or abnormally low expression of FLOT1 may lead to the occurrence of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, major depressive disorder and other diseases. Additionally, it is also associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, pathogenic microbial infection, diabetes‑related diseases, and gynecological diseases, amongst other diseases. In the present review, the structure and localization of FLOT1, as well as the physiological processes it is involved in are reviewed, and then the upstream and downstream regulation of FLOT1 in human disease, particularly in different types of cancer and neurological diseases are discussed, with a focus on potentially targeting FLOT1 for the clinical treatment of several diseases.
