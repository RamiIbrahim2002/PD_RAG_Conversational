Title: Analysis of the Improvement Effect of Nervonic Acid Extracted from Xanthoceras Sorbifolium Bunge Oil on Antioxidant Response and Inflammatory Response in Parkinson's Disease.
PMID: 38176921

Abstract:
An extract of Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge (XSB) oil called nervonic acid (NA) was studied for its potential to ameliorate oxidative stress and inflammation in people living with Parkinson's disease (PD). Recrystallization column chromatography was performed to isolate NA from the XSB oil. Twenty-five C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks old) were randomly assigned to one of five groups (control, model, low, medium, and high dosage).
