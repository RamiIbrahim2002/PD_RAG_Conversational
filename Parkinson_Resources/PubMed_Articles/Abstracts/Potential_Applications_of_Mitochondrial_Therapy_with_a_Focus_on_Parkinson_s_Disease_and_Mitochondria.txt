Title: Potential Applications of Mitochondrial Therapy with a Focus on Parkinson's Disease and Mitochondrial Transplantation.
PMID: 38585467

Abstract:
Both aging and neurodegenerative illnesses are thought to be influenced by mitochondrial malfunction and free radical formation. Deformities of the energy metabolism, mitochondrial genome polymorphisms, nuclear DNA genetic abnormalities associated with mitochondria, modifications of mitochondrial fusion or fission, variations in shape and size, variations in transit, modified mobility of mitochondria, transcription defects, and the emergence of misfolded proteins associated with mitochondria are all linked to Parkinson's disease.
