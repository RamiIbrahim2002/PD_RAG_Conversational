PMID: 37684179

Abstract:
Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) is a novel acupuncture technique developed based on traditional needling principles that aims to alleviate diseases by improving local muscle conditions and blood supply. FSN have been widely used for the treatment of various diseases. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common central nervous system disorder characterized by intense discomfort in the legs, particularly at night, leading to an urge to move the legs for relief. In this study, we report a case in which FSN was used to treat primary RLS.
