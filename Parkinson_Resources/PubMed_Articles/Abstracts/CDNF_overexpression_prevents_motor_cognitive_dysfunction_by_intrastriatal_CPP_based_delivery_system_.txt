Title: CDNF overexpression prevents motor-cognitive dysfunction by intrastriatal CPP-based delivery system in a Parkinson's disease animal model.
PMID: 37837805

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compact (SNpc), and no effective treatment has yet been established to prevent PD. Neurotrophic factors, such as cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF), have shown a neuroprotective effect on dopaminergic neurons. Previously, we developed a cell-penetrating-peptide-based delivery system that includes Asn194Lys mutation in the rabies virus glycoprotein-9R peptide (mRVG9R), which demonstrated a higher delivery rate than the wild-type. In this study, using a mouse PD-like model, we evaluated the intrastriatal mRVG9R-KP-CDNF gene therapy through motor and cognitive tests and brain cell analysis. The mRVG9R-KP-CDNF complex was injected into the striatum on days 0 and 20. To induce the PD-like model, mice were intraperitoneally administered Paraquat (PQ) twice a week for 6Â weeks. Our findings demonstrate that mRVG9R-KP-CDNF gene therapy effectively protects brain cells from PQ toxicity and prevents motor and cognitive dysfunction in mice. We propose that the mRVG9R-KP-CDNF complex inhibits astrogliosis and microglia activation, safeguarding dopaminergic neurons and oligodendrocytes from PQ-induced damage. This study presents an efficient CDNF delivery system, protecting neurons and glia in the nigrostriatal pathway from PQ-induced damage, which is known to lead to motor and cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases such as PD.
