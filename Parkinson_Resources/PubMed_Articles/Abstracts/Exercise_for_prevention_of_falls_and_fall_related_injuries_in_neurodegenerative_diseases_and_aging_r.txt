Title: Exercise for prevention of falls and fall-related injuries in neurodegenerative diseases and aging-related risk conditions: a meta-analysis.
PMID: 37534209

Abstract:
Neurodegenerative diseases often cause motor and cognitive deterioration that leads to postural instability and motor impairment, while aging-associated frailty frequently results in reduced muscle mass, balance, and mobility. These conditions increase the risk of falls and injuries in these populations. This study aimed to determine the effects of exercise on falls and consequent injuries among individuals with neurodegenerative diseases and frail aging people.
